1,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,We need to fix the system that created the problem before putting a tiny band aid on it US colleges were perfectly fine institutions in the s and s and happened to be pretty affordable The quality of education has not improved but the costs to students has skyrocketed
2,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I have one question that I cant seem to get answered If we wipe out k of debt today what happens to kids going to college next year
3,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,My vote is to at least do away with the high interest It should be zero or only get hit with fees if someone misses payments I ve paid over the past years on my k loan income based repayment plan as an architect none of that has touched the principle and the loan is now k
4,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Taxpayer money to pay only once a problem which the goverment created How about ending the law which started it
5,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Makes no sense why only a pariculalr subset of pepople should benefit If they were giving out free cash to the tune of one billion it would be more fsir to simply divide it equally amongst the population
6,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No it treats a symptom and not the cause Students really dont have a choice when it comes to getting the most for their money as a typical undergrad will have to go thru years of basic classes that either do not pertain to their major and or are things they already had in HS Textbooks were an absolute racket when I was in school Now with everything digital you dont own the material but a license to use it for a specified period of time All to the tune of or so Student loan amounts can increase by k and tuition will follow soon after I highly doubt anyone in the exec or legislative branch have the balls to address the problem high tuition waste by schools So while the books can be erased for those holding student loan debt well be right back to this pickle within years
7,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I m a bigger fan on just eliminating the interest to simply cover cost of your loan processing Lower all rates to or whatever Cap tuition rate increases for state universities Make enrolling in loan forgiveness easier Those are better solutions AND THEY DONT COST A PENNY I m not in favor of k write offs It benefits people who signed up for the debt will make significantly more than a non degree worker and doesn t solve the issue of exploding college costs
8,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The bottom of households only hold of the student debt The bottom only hold of the student debt Its a highly regressive policy pretending to be progressive
9,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,All I want is interest free debt Ill take debt forgiveness but I wouldnt call that a good idea Its like rent control useful in the short term but the politicians who propose it dont have long term solutions and will just get reelected off their short term success
10,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Let me first say that my wife and I would benefit greatly from k of student loan forgiveness However I feel that forgiving this much student loan debt will be politically risky for the Democrats This move will alienate the non college educated voters for several elections Now this may be a risk that the Dems should take as this subsection of the electorate is shrinking and the move will make the college educated millennial voters who make up a substantial portion of the Dem base
11,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The problem is that colleges know they can keep inflating their prices and it will always be backed by loans that will be given to anyone willing to take them on I think complete forgiveness is terrible However perhaps lowering the interest rate to minimal amounts At least pay back the principal To think you can just take a loan and then not pay it back is a dangerous path in my opinion
12,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,As someone with student loans Im not gonna say no to forgiveness Its in my self interest Whether its in the national interest or not I dont know
13,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,My impression is that Americans want to have the full college experience and want to live in a residence across the country instead of staying at home but also expect it to be very cheap Can someone enlighten me on what s the cost of a local unsexy university With no rent or anything assuming living with parents
14,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Cancelling student loan debt is an objectively regressive policy People with degrees on average make far more than people without degrees Its subsidizing the segment of the population that statistically is the most well off by taking money out of the pockets of those who are not Imagine free healthcare but only for those have a college degree Imagine a minimum wage but only for those who have a college degree Thats literally what this is Further it does nothing to solve the problem and arguably will make it worse Much like with healthcare the issue isnt who pays for it The issue the high costs in the first place College tuition does not need to be as high as it is but schools just keep spending more and more on pointless bullshit Elizabeth Warren for example made over a little while back at Harvard She taught one class over a two year span This is already on top of her substantial salary as a Senator Is that much really necessary I really dont think so Look at someone more reasonable like Justice Kavanaugh In when he was lecturing at Harvard his salary was in addition to his salary as a federal judge That makes a lot more sense Why cant everything be like that Unless theres a plan to cancel student loan debt every several years or so well be right back here in a few years Students will keep taking out more and more loans because in the back of their heads theyll think the government will just let them off the hook again And because the government showed that theyre willing to do this schools will just make tuition whatever they want because it will get paid off no matter what Imagine someone taking out thousands of dollars in loans for school and then saving up an equal amount for a house and a car Imagine another person taking out thousands of dollars in loans for a house and a car and saving up an equal amount for school In this scenario only one would have their debt cancelled Or what if someone chose to not go to college because they knew they wouldnt be able to pay off loans Are they going to get punished because they chose to do something responsible while people who fucked up get off scot free That is absolutely insane and any politician who advocates for forgiving student loan debt should be deservedly ridiculed
15,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I fully support a UBI and I fucking hate the idea of student loan forgiveness That middle class parent who scrimped and saved every penny going into a fund to fully pay for their child to go to school finally seeing it pay off when their child finished their degree last year NOT GETTING A CENT OF STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS The recent graduate who gave up on their dreams of being a teacher because it just didnt pay well instead opting to use their student loan money to push them into a higher paying career where they were able to pay off their loans in years of employment instead of the years a teacher will take while using current loan forgiveness programs NOT GETTING A CENT OF STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS The blue collar worker who could have succeeded in college but instead decided that going into tens of thousands of dollars in debt was too risky for them so theyre just making ends meet as best they can without a degree NOT GETTING A CENT OF STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS The well off kid who got a federal student loan so they could keep their trust fund sitting in TSLA stock for the past years slacking off getting a basic business degree before they get a guaranteed job from their family friend WILL BE GETTING A TON OF LOAN FORGIVENESS under these plans
16,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No this picks societal winners and losers presents a moral hazard for university admins and doesn t do anything to actually make a college education more affordable It s a short term political win not a long term solution
17,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No that money should go to peoples whose jobs were lost because of the pandemic Not college grads working from home collecting the same paychecks On top of that if this was republicans offering this up it would be classified as systemic racism as minorities would be getting a much smaller piece of the pie
18,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It depends what is the goal Is the goal is to eliminate the voluntary debt of mostly upper middle class white women Then yes it is a good idea If your goal is to lower costs of college which is what it should be If your goal is to get more poorer people into college which is what it should be If you goal is to funnel people into majors with the highest earning potentials and away from low earning majors and they can get jobs were they can pay off their debt which is what it should be Then the answer is no it is a horrible idea
19,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,What ever happened to self responsibility If you are going to be dumb you better be tough Why do we need to continuously coddle everyone This country was not built or has progressed on weakness Parents politicians and everyone now a days are worried about how they will be perceived if they make the correct tough decisions
20,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I don t have any student debt can i get k of mortgage forgiveness Then i can go buy another house and take out a new mortgage
21,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,My complaint would be that poor ppl dont have student loans bc poor ppl dont even consider college to be an option obviously generalizing Why not do something significant like this that affects everyone under a certain income level
22,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No I dont think it is a good idea This is would a transfer of wealth from the of Americans without a degree to those with a with a degree Even more so when you consider that the majority of student debt is held by people with post graduate degrees who make up only of Americans These are precisely the cohort that have benefited the most from the economy in the past few decade while most of those without degrees have either stayed put or have fallen behind It is simply unjust to give a boost to societys designated winners at the expense of the losers the main problem with student loans is that they allowed for the expense of education to inflated rapidly without any effort to keep cost under control Forgiving student does nothing to bring the schools under control and will likely see costs inflate even further since Uncle Sam will eventually forgive most of that debt anyway Thus loan forgiveness will exacerbate number even further It is simply a moral hazard and should be avoided
23,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I ve been thinking we should prioritize community colleges There are a lot of adults who want to better themselves and make up for lost time due to mistakes in adolescence but they are at a loss as to what to do Providing free community college may rectify that problem
24,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Counter question is over paying for a liberal arts degree a good idea In my mind it isnt not many people make it after getting theirs I wouldnt get one and definitely dont want to pay for someone elses mistake They should do what myself and many of my friends did and work through school or start with an associates or trade then find a company that will pay for school Edit I would like to add that I do love the idea of free education But with the approach like the military provides service for your education However for those that are not able to join the military or dont want to I think another term of service should be an option like working for a group like habitat for humanity or something that provides a community benefit
25,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Given that the majority of the country did not attend college let alone take on debt do you think this is going to be a popular way to spend money This is a lot of money to spend on a minority of the population especially when the system that created it still exists
26,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No This does nothing to fix the issue that created the problem In years we will be in the same position again The reason college is so expensive is because it is so easy to get tens of thousands of dollars to pay for it This is because the government backs the loans and the loans cannot be cleared through bankruptcy It is essentially free money for the lenders because there is no risk to them This influx of money combined with the notion that you have to attend college to be successful laughably wrong btw drove demand for college through the roof When demand goes up so do prices Colleges came up with all sorts of new degree programs to absorb the large number of less qualified students applying and then for profit schools sprang up to take the unqualified The bottom line is government backed loans created this problem If the bill doesn t do away with government backed loans that cannot be cleared through bankruptcy then it is nothing more than a vote buying scheme The real solution is to get the government out of the student aid business altogether Within a few years tuition will drop and no more young people will be saddled with a debt they can never hope to repay because banks will stop lending money to everyone with a pulse I would say a combination of paying everyone who currently has or had in the past a student loan up to and ending government backed or funded student loans makes the most sense Obviously the k would go toward any outstanding loan balance first then the rest would go to the individual if they had k or more in debt originally but paid it down or off
27,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I personally think it s a bad idea First you re giving money to people who largely make more money than those who don t have college debt it s regressive The median new college grad starting out makes nearly year more than the median of all only HS grad Second it s a ton of money That s about months worth of Social security Or months at the median US wage of k So wealthier than average people really be getting that big a handout Third it s a terrible stimulus It s beubg sold as one but clearing someone s balance sheet has a fractional impact on increasing cash flow Thus for the amount of money being spend it is a bad stimulus Fourth Student Debt isn t even particularly large T sounds like a lot but Americans also have T in Auto debt and about the same in Credit Card debt And those latter two are actually distributed so the poor have more Fifth College Debt holders have already gotten more than non debt holders They ve gotten or so in deferred interest if they have in debt That s about the sum of the stimulus checks if the is approved Sixth that demographic of College Educated people are less likely to have lost their jobs than those who don t have one So you d be giving money to people less likely to have been impacted by the Corona recession Generally I think you re giving money to people who want it Not need it And especially in the hardship experienced by many it s a very bad tone to throw that money around to people who don t need it
28,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Here is my issue and I don t know how this will be received To me student loan forgiveness is essentially a welfare handout to people above average in income I agree with the idea of welfare for people who lose their jobs and need to buy essentials College increases someone s human capital Point blank you are worth more if you go to college I am on mobile so can t link to the sources but they exist a google away I went to college and I chose my college with cost in mind I come from a single parent household where my mom was a teacher so by no means rich I am and I could pay off my student loans right now Free college exists they are given in scholarships If we want to talk about free college I could be convinced If we wanted to buy all the student loans and not collect interest I could be convinced If we wanted to create scholarships so it was free to most or significantly cheaper for all I could be convinced But providing a handout to people who make above average income doesn t make sense to me especially in the context of them voluntarily taking on the debt in exchange for a increase in their human capital which they get to keep
29,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I used govt loans to get my Ph D In I owed with low interest rates and extended payments It was a no brainer Then the Reagan Republicans privatized student loans i e turned them over to capitalist bankers to set the vulture interest rates and the repayment rules While sucking away federal support for universities driving up tuition costs The bankers have successfully lobbied against any relaxation in student loan interest rates even while other loan rates have collapsed in recent years This is a mismanaged situation of epic proportions https www merriam webster com dictionary clusterfuck Calling a relaxation on student debt obligations costs nothing to taxpayers or to the federal government thanks to the privatization that they already accomplished
30,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Deleted out of spite for reddit admin and overzealous Mods for banning me Reddit is being white washed in time for IPO The most benign stuff is filtered and it is no longer possible to express opinion freely on this website With that said Im just going to open up a new account and join all the same subs so it accomplishes nothing and in fact hides the people who have a history of questionable comments rather than keep them active where they can be regulated Zero Point Every comment I have ever made will be changed to this comment using REDACT this message was mass deleted edited with redact dev
31,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Like many others have stated it fixes the problem but not the cause While I would personally benefit from student debt relief I feel as though something like free community college which the Biden administration has hinted at could be a more substantive step in the right direction
32,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,A year education now is like a high school education decades ago We should socialize it like we did HS primary school before it Neither of my grandfathers made it to HS and they both had careers that provided salaries they could raise kid families on and own property in high COL areas They knew job security and could afford hobbies dreams They would be this year I lost the last one in September after months of watching him fade His fear for his widows well being shes not a natural citizen has always made her living via her own small business is well past retirement age herself without his pension broke my fkn heart What were used to isnt long history normal
33,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If Biden can t unilaterally forgive student loans he should make all interests zero as a workaround Make it so that it applies as long as you make one payment a year
34,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I have worked in Higher Ed for some time There are two main issues that lead to student debt are colleges and the government Inefficient colleges coupled with increased loan availability from the govt leads to students making bad decisions and falling into more debt The colleges themselves Most are massive land holding entities that spend more money on developing land around their campus building amenities at the university rather than investing in staff curriculum development etc Most Schools are trying to sell you an experience rather than an education They will improve dorms gyms stadiums build e sports arenas but have dilapidated classrooms without functioning HVAC systems Inefficiencies Colleges make money on a few programs and lose money on the majority of their programs Colleges will keep programs with low enrollment at a loss because a Professor or Director has clout with the hierarchy Made up programs A lot of colleges do not consult industry as much as they should when developing curriculum instead because of the point above colleges start making programs to fill existing seats You take a few classes from one program a few classes for another and voila you have a completely new degree Now you will only get people so what do you have to do create another made up degree Schools will sell these as highly customizable degrees but basically its all their unwanted leftovers Lack of foresight Colleges will make huge risky investments that take years to develop rather than having a rainy day fund If you are wondering why schools with billion dollar endowments qualified for COVID relief Well that endowment is not liquid Most of it is land holding So the university can sink million into a luxury commercial building that will have no university use however this is an upfront cost that will take years to see revenue So when something like COVID hits and you have two or three of those projects you are SOL Budgeting in general Again going off of my previous inefficiency theme You would be shocked at the amount of gambles Universities make For starters most schools rely on tuition grants donations to function The biggest cash cow is generally the undergrad class If a school gets undergrad student this year they budget next year expecting rather than playing it safe They shell out money for development like that is years away Then al l of the sudden someone gets shot raped on campus and it makes the national news Next years undergrad class ends up having students as a result All of the sudden you are short million in your budget because students arnt paying for tuition rom and board What do you do cut pay increase lay off staff you sure as shit cant take the money back from your development projects Ultimately people leave and the student experience suffers Government FAFSA Loan Limits continue to move up this allows colleges to continue raising the cost of attendance without having repercussions A typical masters degree costs k in the US and most people complete them in about two years Why because the aggregate limit per year for standard grad loans is The aggregate limit for total Stafford graduate loans is about K Since you cannot take out more than in Stafford govt undergrad loans So essentially every person who gets into a Masters program can pay for it fully only using loans If this limit goes up the average tuition rate will move right with it Even though this is not the govts goal it is essentially exacerbating the cost of attendance by allowing massive amounts of student loans to be taken out There is very little that the govt is doing to keep schools accountable infact by increasing loan limits each year they are doing the opposite They are continuously rewarding bad behavior with more funding If there were a way to limit the amount of loans the cost of tuition would inevitably have to go down though this would take time
35,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I feel it doesnt address the root of the problem I would prefer they invest in free community college and pre K rather than throw money at people
36,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Lets say people each have X dollars and they both want a college education a new car a shiny fancy widget and a Disney vacation Person A spends his X dollars on college education and borrows money to buy the car the widget and the vacation Person B does the opposite borrows for college and spends their X dollars on the car the widget and the vacation They both have the same debt same education same car etc Why should we pay off Person Bs debt and not Person A
37,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yeah I paid off my loans already but Im totally for this Those loans are crippling to so many people IMO it stiffles innovation by forcing people to take soul sucking corporate gigs instead of going off to innovate and find ways to make a big impact on society Think of it as an investment in the economy The real solution should be to make college more affordable though so people dont have to take out crippling loans to go to school
38,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I am against this idea because I have made sacrifices in order to not have student loan debt
39,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No It s not a good idea Besides the obvious unfairness of it it has many unintended consequences Recent grads who now have less debt to pay can accept lower salaries and they ll begin bidding down wages which just adds even more injury to people who already paid off their loans It will only lead to more reckless and irresponsible borrowing If you want people to stop accruing massive student debt stop guaranteeing massive student loans It really is that simple Colleges will be forced to lower prices
40,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No its a very stupid idea It is a wealth transfer to people who will already on the whole end up wealthier than the average American since college grads still have much higher lifetime net earnings than non college grads Furthermore it only helps those who currently hold debt Not those who have paid their debt off not those who have yet to take on debt not those who chose cheaper colleges to take on less debt not those worked through out college to pay for their education not those who joined the military to have their college payed for No one forced people to take on huge amounts of student debt they made that decision for themselves That doesnt mean there shouldnt be some type of relief for people who were deceived or are truly being crushed right now but there is no reason it has to be complete forgiveness and it should not be at the expense of other people who made different decisions Now cancelling the interest on government loans some type of universal public service loan forgiveness relief for people who were duped by unscrupulous for profit institutions these are reasonable ideas that we could have a conversation about Blanket student debt forgiveness is one of the dumber and least equitable ideas that the left seem to be in love with recently It is baffling to me
41,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No its a dumb idea How is that fair for hard working people who didnt go to college and just worked the whole time now make less money AND we end up paying the way for those that dont want to re pay their debt Disgusting is what it is
42,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,At the very least interest should be forgiven Education shouldn t be a business the profit motive of public education is why degrees are now both devalued and more expensive I also think public service forgiveness should be pro rated monthly rather than only after years of service with easily made paperwork error disqualifiers I worked years in a public service job at a significantly lower than private sector salary while paying an IBR monthly payment that didn t cover interest Life changed my ability to hold the public service job and now I owe more than I borrowed
43,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It doesnt matter anymore if its a good idea or not could be or even in loan forgiveness Only way the Fed can keep this ship afloat is to print print print Based on foundational economic principles IMO not a good idea long term but we are well passed standards and principles and have been in uncharted territory for a long time now In the economy of I think it has to happen
44,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If I get the k plus back that I paid off instead of buying new cars and going on vacations like all of my pals did that are still struggling with paying off their debt sure thing
45,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its a band aid Why not instead ask why college tuitions have gone up far faster than inflation for decades And why public colleges with multi billion dollar endowments need to raise tuitions at all
46,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If we forgive the debt and make school free then it cheapens the bs paper It will also make people work as hard for a bs ba as they do did for a hs diploma When things mean nothing then nobody will strive for anything
47,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I dont think it is a good idea People signed an agreement Live up to what you agreed to It seems like a slap in the face to those who paid their way through college without taking on massive debts I think it would be a good idea to teach our children to be more financially responsible There is a way to go to school without student loans Working multiple jobs while going to school and spending what you can afford is a solid option
48,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Getting the government out of the cart Blanche student loan business would actually stop the bleeding It s profoundly stupid that the government is handing out so many loans for low paying degrees to high school grads
49,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,i dont want to pay for someone else financial mistake we all gotta find a way to get by were all working toward a better life
50,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I have two degrees My first bachelors degree is not even close to being paid off my second degree was paid in full In fact there were so many years of unemployment and low paying jobs I could never afford to make any payments So if this goes through If my FAFSA loans have switched companies several times over the years and are currently held by a company called Great Lakes Would I still be eligible for the K forgiveness even though my loans are over years old and are upwards of K
51,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Id rather a check used only for debt acquired by December of sent to everyone Not everyone whos suffering has student debt Our sources of burden are different but general debt relief to all would be a huge boon
52,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Sounds like it would be very inefficient if the intention is as a stimulus Also it wouldnt have anything for people who took out loans and repaid them nor who considered whether they could repay them and decided not to take the loan And it wouldnt fix the problem with education costs
53,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I don t know the solution but as a person that had k in loans and has paid a month for over years so close to k my principal has only gone down k I am sitting at a k balance right now This interest free period has allowed me to save up all of my payments so that I can actually pay down principal I currently have k saved So after one year of interest free forbearance I will have paid more down on my principal than I have making payment for over years When I consolidated my loans interest was percent I will never get out from under this at that rate I am not asking for forgiveness but would like the option to refinance to a lower interest rate My k house will be paid off before my student loans And that s disgusting Edit typos
54,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I d rather cancel the ability to loan for college If colleges see that people literally can t afford college their prices plummet as their student ratio does
55,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Big fat no But they should be able to be defaulted and all future loans should slowly be transitioned back to the free market
56,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Degrees are investments Just because you did not make a good investment by getting a niche degree that doesnt pay out or you didnt finish your degree doesnt mean others should be responsible for paying back for your mistake This would be like bailing out wallstreet investors because they made a bad investment So no I do not think its a good idea The money will have to come from somewhere to which would be the taxpayer and not all taxpayers went to school In fact most taxpayers did not go to college A better alternative is to drop the federal loan program A lot of the reason why school has become so expensive is because so much money has become available since just about anyone can take out a loan due to them being federally secured The school ends up getting its money and the lender and borrower are on the hook Schools have become giant scams offering so many niche degrees that really have no real value in the real world and so many people are getting hooked with them The reality is most of us have no need to go to higher education Learning a trade or going straight into the workforce is the better alternative Im on the type that unless someone else is willing to pay for your degree as in you got rich parents or you earn a full scholarship youre better off not going to college
57,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,All loans matter so if you re gonna forgive their student debt I want you to forgive my mortgage and my car loans too
58,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,They are the geniuses with their fancy degrees let them figure it out If you forgive their loans those who paid out of pocket are they getting some of their money back Those who served in the military just so they can get the GI bill and afford college are they getting money back as well Why is college cost rising time the rate of inflation
59,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It s a good idea if it s done alongside a serious plan to reduce costs Simply erasing debt does nothing to fix long term cost increases A lot of posts have mentioned administrative costs etc as a main driver of cost increases and I agree but I think one change that also needs to be made is student expectations of what college is I went to college in Europe for a year and the facilities were very bare bones American students have an expectation of what colleges should be fancy student center new sports facilities fancy dorms and that is a big driver of costs too Too much focus is on the college experience rather than the pursuit of an education
60,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,What about people whose families sacrificed and saved and helped put them through college Do we get grand too
61,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This is not smart Why should the people who played by the rules be punished and have to pay for those that signed a contract saying they would pay back a certain amount for getting loaned a certain amount Usually if you borrow money from someone you pay it back or get fucked
62,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Many Democrats in Congress have been floating the idea of a k student loan forgiveness as a possible stimulus Democrats float a lot of ideas it doesnt mean they have any intention of pursuing them
63,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,For me personally it would be life changing But it seems like it would be more impactful to get at the root of the problem first making higher education more affordable
64,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If they do that they should give a retroactive tax credit to those who have already paid on either their own or their childrens college
65,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No That would be unfair as hell to the people that worked their butts off to work before through college to pay for it without going into debt
66,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No moral hazard Also a wealth transfer to the highest expected earners in the country
67,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Depends on the context of the question Certainly it makes far more sense than the tax cuts a few years back did but I think you would anger many blue collar voters who never went to college as well as some people who already paid off their loans Personally I think it should be means tested so the people benefitting from what would be a massive government handout are people who actually need it not just want it and perhaps it should be closer to an interest rate reduction thats retroactive so its not strictly a handout But Im fine with whatever they go through with on a personal level I may have paid my loans off already but Im also not the sort of person who thinks I suffered so you should too
68,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Why not refund some of tuition payments made over the last X years And increase the amount of current government financial support of post HS public education while actually trying to curb extravagance Students arent the only ones whove struggled to pay Many parents grand parents and relatives have helped And some students worked hard to pay off their debts already Some by working A LOT during school
69,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I feel really bad for students with private loans They just get screwed as usual I wish the Feds could come up with some way to help those students
70,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Encouraging young people to embark on careers that pay very little with huge student loans is almost criminal I feel sorry for those that have or more debt with no way of paying back the loan I think colleges and universities share in the blame for this mess also Some ideas military service like national guard Credits for volunteering Forgiving interest that has been added to the loans There has to be some accountability for there actions so just writing of the loan I feel is foolish and not fair to the students that busted there ass off paying for there education It sends a bad message saying doing nothing has more rewards than doing things right
71,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No It punishes people that didnt go to college It punishes savers I worked full time and went to college full time No loans I lived as cheaply as possible I have friends that lived just like they did when their parents were footing the bill Why should they get a leg up over me Fund schools better Only give debt relief to those that give back to their communities No free passes
72,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Much like social security student loans are a good idea implemented horribly that have gotten out of hand While the immediate effect of student loan cancellation will be good as more young people will be more finically secure and move onto owning a house sooner this will just be another mountain of debt onto the already ballooning problem that no one is seriously addressing
73,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Although its just helping a symptom clearing student debt for of the country would change a lot of lives
74,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Seems unfair and smells like a handout for political points because it really doesn t address the issue
75,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If you re a small business say small restaurant repair shop salon etc in a city with people and of them have student loan payments at an average of per month you d think it s a pretty good idea
76,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Why should the government bail out adults who decided to spent money on an education that wont ever earn that money back for them
77,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Far fewer people should go to college and lots of studies should just be dropped from the curriculum In turn student loans should be government backed and zero interest So trade schools no more underwater basket weaving or lesbian dance theory and truly affordable education that benefits society as a whole
78,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No Something most people dont realize is money doesnt come from thin air So the money is coming from the tax payers and thus furthering the collapse of the economy
79,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Trillion dollars of stimulus can be really good for the economy Taking million out of debt is good for the economy and confidence and relieves the burden of students who will have a difficult time finding jobs in this economy Those I see who are against the idea of debt forgiveness for individuals were ok with giving trillions to top already profitable corporations in the form of previous stimulus and tax cuts for The people with student loans will be paying taxes for many years to cover these debts that made the richest richer We will also pay for years to recover some of the forgivness of student loans but I am ok with that In fact I would much rather pay taxes in the future for student loan forgiveness than I would for the So yea let us even the playing field just a tiny bit because we will never get waht the got just in
80,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It s a stimulus to the economy in that the people who are repaying these loans are very likely to spend that money on other things if they could The stimulus of million people having extra money on hand every month for a one time cost is pretty amazing really It s not the best way to do a stimulus but it is good we do need the recovery coming out of Covid and most importantly it s the only cleanly available option it s something Biden can actually do not some theoretical thing that in practice one party will block just to keep the other party from getting a win
81,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I don t think it s a terrible idea but I do think there are more effective ways to address the problems at hand I also think we need to address the source of the problem Getting tuition prices under control partnered with forgiveness can make sense but forgiveness alone does not
82,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes Maybe our generation would have freedom to do something to actually fix the failed system if we were free from the shackles of debt No one will go to college to become a teacher if its going to take them yrs to pay off the debt Which means teachers arent evolving but that damn paywall is Every Day
83,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Ditch the interest rate Pay off the amount that is interest Maybe make it like we do in the UK where you pay nothing unless you make a certain amount and the amount you pay is based on how much more than that you earn Universally paid university is just taxing the less intelligent to pay for the more intelligent and it s disgusting
84,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes its a good thing Forgive the debt and revamp the system People arguing against are butthurt boomers
85,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Maybe But educational FAFSA loans are already easy to get And if you stay away from the arts theyre rediculously easy to repay I paid my tuition off with years of engineering interning alone But even if i had taken a loan i could have paid it back with my first years salary All you have to do is work a bit and not pick a shitty major But on second thought most people cant even do that right Maybe we do need free tuition
86,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Why stop there whats next a car payment I would argue a person will make more money with a pickup truck than a year gender studies degree
87,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I dont think educational debt should exist in the first place much like medical debt Higher education should be universal and free at the point of use like K so why not make it PreK The idea that more people getting college degrees lowers the value of the degree is ridiculous a more educated population is good for the society x B The debt forgiveness should be done in conjunction with making all public universities as well as community college and trade schools tuition free I would take the debt forgiveness a step further as well and offer some kind of repayment to those who have already paid off their students loans x B I dont even think these policies go far enough with regards to education but thats whats within the scope of possibility within my lifetime
88,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I saw this idea on another thread but specific majors and courses should have a correlative cost to the average starting salary they yield in the job market at the time of graduation In general the cost of education is ludicrous and the textbook industry specifically is run by greedy thugs Nobody should be in student debt into their mid s when their trying to start a family
89,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Why do people still argue from worries about cost Do people still think were on the gold standard
90,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,its not its going to be a massive transfer of wealth to relatively well off americans
91,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The real question no one seems to be asking is can we afford to do this The government spent so much money last year because of COVID and weve been piling up debt for years Paying down the debt and cutting spending isnt sexy but its the responsible move to make
92,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,First make student loan debt be dischargeable is that a word in bankruptcy This will keep banks from throwing money at children which in turn would make the colleges less likely to charge ridiculous tuition Then forgive debt for people who are working at charities non profits hub zone small businesses and in fields that help people like the current loan forgiveness program teachers social workers etc in poor areas Allow student loan payments not just the current in interest as it is today to be considered deductible up to I dont think blanket debt forgiveness is a good idea of we dont fix the underlying issues I also think thing it to good work would help people who could never have even imagined going to college in the first place
93,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,ITT Loan forgiveness doesnt solve the real problem so why bother Why should we pay for other peoples mistakes Maybe not everyone should go to college etc Every week this question gets asked Every week the same old ideas are trotted out I for one am glad nobody listens to redditors
94,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Healthcare and Education are the biggest businesses and currently they are not helpful to the people of the country You go to a hospital or enter college and there is a huge bill to pay This loan forgiveness can help many people but it s a temporary solution
95,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Well in other counties they don t have to pay such extravagant amounts for a secondary education so yes I think the US is being held financially to an absurd standard that the rest of the world is not It s bullshit Along with healthcare too
96,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I think this is a great idea However the underlying problem is the educational system It needs to be free
97,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It creates perverse incentives People will rush to take out loans in order to get in on the forgiveness
98,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its a nuance but It dies not apply to private student loans This is the bullshit part to me Why Because the federal loans had ridiculous interest rates Of course those would be paid off first because they were legitimately predatory literally required before private additionals for certain students Id argue if at any time you had federal loans and you still have any balance remaining that should still count
99,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I think it is a bad idea to only do federal loans Either all student debt or nothing for me
100,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No Too many of today s young people has been given everything they wanted their whole lives and because of it they don t understand the value of anything Everyone else has had to pay for their education they should too You can see too many young kids that think the world owes them something It s time they learn to stand on their own two feet Mommy and Daddy won t always be able to kiss it and make it better The real world is hard they need to learn to earn something they can be proud of If they got a stupid degree that won t pay for it s self they only have themselves to blame they won t like it they will try to blame it on everyone else but they need to learn to take the responsibility and the blame so day The sooner the better
101,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,A person needs to be responsible for his financial decisions taxpayers shouldnt pay for someone elses debt
102,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,People who have never had student loans Why should my taxes pay for people who took out loans its their own fault People who have had student loans and paid them off over most their life No they should have to suffer because I suffered People with student loans from years ago that theyre still paying off in their mid to late s and cant afford to save any money because their entire paycheck goes to paying off the loan Please help
103,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It doesnt go far enough While there are definitely individuals who need relief it is the system that is broken Im all for taxing the rich and corporations to pay for fixing the system though I work for a university and some of the bloat is just absurd The attempt to adopt a corporate style organizational structure with directors and assistant directors and such is toxic as hell we should run like a business NO YOU FUCKING SHOULDNT YOUR GOALS ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OR THEY SHOULD BE Also from my perspective the corporate mindset of profit at all costs is literally cancer I would mandate that all businesses be run as social good corporations And all corporations that touch on public health or well being must be run as non profits that means you healthcare and pharma Doesnt do any good to forgive k now when millions more young adults are currently racking up debt
104,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,How about dont take out loans worth way more than the value of your degree
105,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Perfect opportunity for a generation of kids to give college the middle finger and just not go Just for One year every senior in high school just go out and work for a year I know everyone has different situations but the only way universities will lower their tuition is to hit them where it hurts in their pockets Also no one forced the previous generation to go in debt Learn a trade that s my advice
106,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This comment section is just a bunch of crabs trying to pull each other back down into the barrel
107,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Imagine all the people who had their debt cleared and now have spending money I d bet a lot of money that consumer spending significantly increases if they canceled student debt Wouldn t this be a good way to frame the issue
108,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I attended college in the second half of the s and my tuition granted at a state college was around semester At today s tuition prices for state residents at public colleges and for out of state students at state schools for the school year it s the colleges and universities that should be begging forgiveness
109,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Im down for it certainly since that should just about clear it for me so I wouldnt have to spend the money in savings on it but we should pair it with improving the system so it doesnt keep happening in the future It is just like the minimum wage we raise it every so often rather then building a system where it naturally increases over time to account for inflation and the cost of living
110,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This is sound policy and will boost the economy But it doesn t address the fundamental issue of schools overcharging I m six figures in student loan debt and when I recall looking at my US medical school itemized costs there were a ton of extraneous fees that I never understood
111,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I say consider it like an investment yes its a huge upfront cost but could pay off long term Think of the amount of people who would be free to take chances and opportunities that they couldnt have with k in debt Nobody really wants to live in debt especially when youre just starting out If our current generation was given a life time chance to make big decisions without this burden of debt who knows where we might end up in Maybe somewhere better than here
112,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No Just cancel all student debt You really wanna fucking party make tuition free then youll see a boom
113,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,My solution Limit interest on student loans to The Federal Government becomes the only lender ALL college students automatically qualify It is not based on credit score or parental income It is solely based on whether the person is attending college If a college wants to accept loan money from the government then cost per credit hour is set to a government standard Payments are made via of paychecks similar to how social security is taken out OR it is computer and owed as part of tax bill This would eliminate predatory lenders keep school costs from continuing to explode make schooling something people can and will pay back
114,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Id say yes but maybe pass a law that lets the students get away with the just flat out not paying back the loan instead of having the government paying the loan The banks and the colleges are plenty wealthy already
115,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,How much did we spend on the War on Terror How many Americans died because of terrorism What was the cost of that war per individual killed by a terrorist Same question for Covid We spent a stupid amount of money dropping millions of dollars of missiles on cave men We have the money
116,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It would be a boost to the economy and be a huge help to a lot of people But in the long run there could be better steps The first of which is lower student loan interest as close to zero as possible Then people could use the income based plans and actually pay down their loans not just interest
117,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Freeing most Americans from the amount of debt equal to a nice luxury car is a life changing move That would allow many people including myself to buy houses cars start businesses etc And while we do that we should also take a look at how we got into that situation in the first place and look at how we can provide quality education to all Americans who want it free of cost Many other countries do it and the median wealth of those countries is much higher than in America comparatively looking at property ownership financial stability
118,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,College should be free The only reason its not is because the military needs cannon fodder
119,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It hurts literally nobody but the university that is making billions off of their students unpaid athletic exploits
120,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Easy yes The rest of the developed world pays for people to go to school It s just another reason America has fallen
121,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,In no particular order Student loan interest needs to be halted indefinitely The entire student loan system needs to be reformed and there should be more restrictions on borrowing There needs to be a renewal of public investment into public and community colleges Some amount of debt should be relieved Though I dont think it should be k and or income driven loan forgiveness needs to be reformed However the higher education debt crisis is directly tied to the job sector Why are people going to school Because without it the avenues for a living income are disappearing There needs to be a number of economic reforms to revive the middle class to make going to college not so essential Additionally there needs to be investment endorsement and government backing of alternative certification routes for well paying professions Its doable in the IT field where theres multiple places you can seek credentials like CompTIA Cisco etc without needing an actual degree
122,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its a great idea which is why Americans think its bad America always does the right thing after weve done everything else
123,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,All of it should be forgiven and all education should be nationalized Private schools should not exist The only thing that should prevent entrance to a certain college or university is shitty grades and test scores or a bad essay not because you cant pay Loving all the centrists in this thread bitching and whining about how its a wealth transfer to the upper class Upper class people dont have debt everyone
124,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,We cant have our kids having a good life Next thing you know youll want to pay them a living wage How ever will they be forced to work as slaves forever No schools need to Jack up prices more Sarcasm in case you didnt get it Fuck the banks erase all the dept get the economy back to where it was when the boomers were young The banks make plenty without grinding the shit out of people There was a time when people were paid enough to not go into dept for a regular life and we can go back to that at the mere cost of a few ers yachts Raise minimum wage to tell me a country that has done this and is worse off for it please America is the has the richest people and the biggest wealth divide If America wants to have the reputation it used to it will have to do something for its citizens aside from take their taxes and over enforce the police millionaires
125,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Increase and expand the pell program to cover tuition cost for everyone maintaining a base gpa Be serious about enforcement Those folks with debt now will still have to pay for their kids education This would be a much more fair program Ease the burden and fix the problem at the same time Rising tide floats more boats
126,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,My way of thinking is that those people willingly signed the loans so Im not sure how I feel about debt forgiveness Now on the other end for those who are thinking about going to college costs need to go way down As in stopping the textbook bullshit Textbooks accounted for of my community college expenses if I just count tuition textbooks and fees That needs to change If a college course deems one expensive book to be necessary then they can pay for a classroom set for students to rent every semester and just charge for damage That was really my only issue
127,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Maybe just maybe only a reduction in their debt but not forgive the whole debt Its not like they didnt get anything out of it
128,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Depends on a lot of factors Reducing the interest to would be a good start Some people will never be able to pay back their student loans due to various reasons This is a tough problem to solve in an equitable way
129,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Debt forgiveness without making public college free is a dumb idea It just kicks the can down the road further Like are we going to do this every years and cost ourselves another trillion every time
130,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It is not Address college affordability but you can t just wipe trillion of debt it s absurd especially after we ve been giving out free money during the pandemic Not to mention it simply wouldn t be fair to people who have just finished paying or worked multiple jobs to not incur debt
131,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,My thought is hmm I know my logic might be off but here goes Make these folks pay their k to the bank if they re capable Those that are capable will be fine Those that can t will struggle They ll do the best they can They might make it and go on to be productive members of society They might also self destruct under the weight of the debt We need to weigh the benefit to society for each option
132,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,For me personally Yes its a fantastic idea please do it without delay For the country at large Ehhh probably negligible short term benefit at best
133,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Id say education can be a great investment but you shouldnt take on debt for a program that doesnt have good ROI Maybe instead of just generally forgiving debt let students who attended sub par programs get refunds Those who went to good programs and then failed are probably less common and those who attended good programs probably have no problem with large debt I graduated with k in student loan debt in paid it off in under years Most people from my graduating class had no problem paying off debt and more recent graduates also tend to do well Lots of sub par programs exist and set their pricing based on what students can get in subsidized loans Have the schools refund them and stop charging new students more than the program is worth
134,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It would be good to do but bad policy The problem this attempts to address is the onerous cost of higher education a one time partial and biased relief fails utterly at that and may even reinforce the fundamental problem In its place I would argue for among other things legislation placing limits on various costs at public universities chiefly a percentage cap on administrative costs athletics and limiting funding by school college Many that end in the word studies do nothing to benefit their graduates
135,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its a non starter I imagine You can craft a program that going forwards forgives or otherwise obviates student loans but doing so retroactively is incredibly uneven in application and just a landmine in terms of accountability Theyd get hammered on it if it ever passed which they dont really care about because it never will
136,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,More than likely the gov isn t getting back the majority of what s owed Why not cancel a nice chunk which prob wipes out the majority of SL debt for most holders in turn raising their FICO scores and allowing them to secure higher credit limits which will be pumped back into the economy
137,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes as long as its also paired with new systems that make incurring such debt for future generations a thing of the past Bloated administrative offices rather than the liberal arts programs those offices continually sacrifice should be the first to go in the spirit of cutting college costs back down to a reasonable amount
138,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If we can apply modern monetary theory to print trillions in just the last couple of years to prop up banks and overvalued trading markets then we can do the same to help average citizens and carry out public works projects which unlike bailing out corrupt institutions and keeping bubbles from popping actual have a return on investment
139,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Probably both the k and fixing the root cause so others don t get so much in debt in the future is the right way to go I m from a relatively poor country in Europe and I studied abroad still in Europe paying around k yearly at a top university Yes my parents helped me and they struggled but now I have a good career If I had to pay for my education I would have never been able to afford one My point is most countries here have free education for their citizens and very cheap for those from abroad If this is possible and normal here why wouldn t it be in the US
140,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,When our educations system is bloated with bullshit and then elementary school teachers are crippled by debt to work a shit pay job just so they can teach our nations up and coming future which is a absolute paramount position to our functionality to come is insane Its terrifying almost What the fuck are we doing Its suicide
141,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No it s a terrible idea Rather than solve the college cost problem it simply exacerbates it It s another handout to the upper middle class Democrats need to drop these regressive policies
142,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Sounds similar to one version of the English system My interest is at and repayments start when you meet an income threshold
143,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Do I hope it goes through Hell yeah I would love to owe less money Do I think it s a good idea No not really It wouldn t stimulate the economy much and it wouldn t solve the overarching problem of bs college costs It would however save me about a month income based repayment No I m never going to pay the interest off I ll be paying for it for years and will owe more than I borrowed
144,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,We gotta also think about how private side of the equation This is great for federal borrowers but there s a serious problem on the private loan side as well They re kind sol unless there s meaningful legislation passed for them as well
145,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I have very little knowledge about the topic However you should bare in mind that every debt involving the government will be paid by taxpayers poor middle class rich sooner or later
146,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its a good political talking point but this article makes good points Forgiving Student Debt Is Unwise and Unjust https www wsj com articles forgiving student debt is unwise and unjust
147,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I don t think it s a great idea College graduates already traditionally earn a significant amount more than their non graduate counterparts so forgiveness just gives a financial boost and further drives the gap between the upper middle and middle The better approach would be a UBI if you were interested in introducing a financial solution This would benefit everyone involved At minimum though they need to start capping interested rates to something significantly lower Like Then start regulating these colleges who are charging far more than they were years ago and the quality has not improved
148,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,As a student I feel like I can give some input on this Im not sure if just giving money to a relatively privileged class is the best move I would rather this political capital be spent on improving healthcare or something that benefits everyone Its not like they can change everything I think if i was emperor of life i would do some sort of matching system x or maybe even x what the student would pay every month post graduation It effectively does the same thing and I think it may be a lot more palatable to the conservative and moderate crowd
149,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It s a bad idea politically and policy wise They need to find ways to control the cost of college they need to make student loans backed by the US government interest free and they need to do things to help people that can t didn t go to college for financial reasons I don t think forgiving the debts of only certain people with only current debt balances of one type of voluntary debt does anything but pander to a group of people that are typically in a better financial situation job wise accomplishes much of anything except pandering and pissing off nearly everyone else
150,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes and no First thing to note is that those with high k student loans tend to be folks who went to graduate school They should already have a decent paying job at this point Second and the biggest reason we have to do something about rising school costs before we touch anything else year olds are effectively given blank checks There ought to be a hard limit to how many loans a kid can take out per year public and private Bankruptcy ought to be a way to get out of student loans There would have to be certain stipulations though otherwise kids would just declare immediately out of college Force interest rates lower across the board Though the result will be much more choosy loaners Sone other measures If they exist Perhaps banning schools from forcing students to live on campus more than one year or even that If we don t do anything about the systemic problems then a debt clear will just open the floodgates to more bullshit Not to mention increasing the debt even further than COVID has
151,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Only after we fix stupid Unless thats fixed the problem will happen again
152,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Im not attacking your character Im telling you that youre dead wrong Im not gonna argue with you back and forth all day Youre so far off that sending you any facts and figured wont do anything Itd be like sending scientific journal articles to a flat earther
153,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It doesn t cost T that s the outstanding debt It s already been spent This is more like a write off
154,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Overall no because it does not solve the problem of controlling higher education costs Higher education is becoming a competition of destination resorts marketing sports teams athletic facilities swimming pools and luxury living Most educational facilities are staying the same with new paint and lighting Lecture halls are similar everywhere you go And because it s a resort race costs go up across the industry the buyers year olds heavily influenced by marketing and not the best financially use borrowed money and incur debt that can t be discharged through bankruptcy At they re expected to make financial decisions that hang over their entire lives Solutions It s probably impossible to eliminate debt based funding Maybe cap annual loans based on degree industry starting salary and placement If you want to be a petroleum engineer computer engineer or math major you get higher loan caps than art history If you attend an art school in a hot market that has excellent placement you have higher loan caps than a bio science program with a poor placement record
155,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No It still leaves out people who are on their way to that aka us current students and it fixes nothing It s simply throwing money at a major problem for political points It does nothing to address crazy college tuitions and student loans Are they willing to keep throwing k in forgiveness every year Likely not so I hope this doesn t happen
156,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The for profit schools I know need to be more heavily regulated I worked at one for over years Every time the title funding increased the would match the maximum amount I knew of a nonprofit school that taught the same courses for FAA certification less than miles away were a third of the price Identical programs dictated by the FAA
157,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Here is what I would suggest Put an expiration on new student loans along with a maximum of income Say yr and AGI for example This will effectively make lenders and colleges accountable in the equation too You won t be able to get a k loan for underwater basket weaving because there is no ROI Lenders won t loan more than they know they can recover Colleges can t charge more than the degree is worth because no lender will make funds available Students still have skin in the game but there is an end in sight Do away with government loans and grants going forward It is counter intuitive but the ease of getting money is just a way for colleges to raise their baseline prices because it s available money for anyone Cap existing loan interest at the current bond rate It s effectively guaranteed except in death so the risk is fairly equivalent Colleges will need to rethink their models a bit They won t be able to keep adding on amenities like a posh arms race I went to a college that had a dedicated health center that I m sure cost a few percent of my tuition but a dedicated bus to the city hospital down the street would have been cheaper and provided better care Colleges need to embrace their communities not form their own gated ones
158,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The whole college system is a scam to steal from parents and students For example all three of my kids went to WVU because they didn t get accepted into Maryland Maryland of course would ve been cheaper with instate tuition All three of my children got really high academic scholarships at WVU which made it affordable How is it that they got scholarships at WVU and paying out of state tuition but didn t get into Maryland I m still paying more then instate WV residents but not by much Now I have a higher income then most WV residents A lot of WV residents can t afford instate tuition for their children so they re effectively cut off from going The whole thing is a scam I think for public colleges instate children should be automatically accepted based on some basic criteria Tuition should be based also on income but still affordable for anyone If they re spots open then fine accept out of state or foreign exchange students Make it fair for anyone to be given a shot at a college degree Loan forgiveness needs to based on several criteria s not just one sweeping overhaul That s not fair to the people who saved or paid their debt down I do think a giant overhaul is needed in several areas in our country Healthcare and college tuition I truly believe a lot of issues can be solved with these two giant issues we are facing as a nation We also need to get rid a this propaganda system we are living with and use logic to make these types of decisions Not scare tactics
159,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I mean yeah Free college and high education standards have literally picked countries out of poverty and into the future Now imagine if you had an already rich country and did the same thing
160,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes but its not a solution We must also change the underlying system causing our current conditions
161,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Better issues Why are companies like Enron allowed to both provide student loans and also own private colleges where they can charge k year for tuition Why are student loans permanent
162,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I see a lot of people arguing against the bandaid approach While I agree that this is not a long term solution I think it ignores the over million who are struggling now I think we have to look at this as a two part issue We need an economic mash unit to triage the immediate bullet wound in addition to measures to prevent it from happening in the future I m really curious if anyone has an explain to me like I m simplification of the difference between colleges in the s and s vs colleges now and where they sourced their funding as I am a pleb
163,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No we should focus on decreasing the cost of student loan debt Government gets involved and causes student loan prices to sky rocket now they re coming in with another solution why don t people wake up to this
164,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes The working class is being slowly ground to dust as living standards for everyone below mega rich slowly slide to oblivion However It is not a free action It costs money And that money needs to be paid by the rich PAYING GODDAMNED TAXES Which they effectively do not Poor people pay higher taxes than rich people by income percent And that is insane

166,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,First democrats says education should be for all A loan is a just a loan you will get it back Now democrats say debt can be forgiven Sounds like a scam Just a way to get free education Free education also means bigger government thus more politically appointed jobs paid by the public

169,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,In Bill Clinton and Al Gore published a book called Putting People First How We Can All Change America https books google com books id LzJ AAAAMAAJ that outlined what they would do if they were elected Since the late s wages for the bottom percent of earners had essentially been stagnant In their view the solution to stagnant incomes wasn t government intervention and regulation but creating the best educated best trained workforce in the world What you earn depends on what you learn they said Sadly however that didnt exactly turn out to be the case According to the Economic Policy Institute https www epi org publication causes of wage stagnation B etween and real wages fell for the entire bottom percent of the wage distribution Even wages for the bottom percent of four year college graduates have been flat since and wages in most STEM science technology engineering and math occupations have grown anemically over the past decade And this the Economic Policy Institute maintains was the result of policy decisions This dismal wage growth is the result of intentional policy choices made on behalf of those with the most income wealth and political power As explained below these choices fall into five broad categories the abandonment of full employment as a main objective of economic policymaking declining union density various labor market policies and business practices policies that have allowed CEOs and finance executives to capture ever larger shares of economic growth and globalization policies Collectively these policy decisions have shifted economic power away from low and middle wage workers and toward corporate owners and managers Joe Biden of all people then delivered the knockout blow when in he was one of the most enthusiastic supporters of the disastrous bankruptcy bill that made it nearly impossible for borrowers to reduce their student loan debt A study from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York https www newyorkfed org medialibrary media research epr forthcoming morg pdf PDF found that the bankruptcy bill led to a surge of foreclosures that may not have happened otherwise translating to an additional foreclosures every three months So in quick summary students borrowed in order to invest in higher education based on the assurance that what they earned would be based on what they learned and when policy decisions by the politically powerful undermined that their debts were treated differently than other debts Americans incur and prohibited by law from being discharged in bankruptcy That is just a moral argument for forgiving student debt though from an economic standpoint https www investopedia com student loan debt statistics and outlook Moody s Investor Service predicts wiping out student debt would yield a stimulus to economic activity that is comparable to tax cuts in the near term according to reporting by CNBC Over the longer term it could increase homeownership and boost the creation of small businesses Outright debt cancellation would boost real gross domestic product GDP by billion to billion per year according to one study from Bard College s Levy Economics Institute But what about students who didnt take out loans or paid their loans off how could forgiving the student debt of others be fair to them It may seem harsh but frankly we often have to accept government policies and particularly those with economic consequences that are not always fair Some people adopted babies in the years before the adoption tax credit was passed for example was it fair to them that taxpayers who adopted children a year or two later had their adoption expenses subsidized by taxpayers when they had to pay the full amount themselves What about people who purchased their first homes before the first time homebuyer programs were adopted What about people whose children aged out just before the enhanced child care credits kicked in What about those who lost their homes because they lost their jobs in the Great Recession while the federal government bailed out the banksters who were actually responsible for the economic collapse The list is actually fairly endless and while its understandably difficult for some to accept forgiving student debt is the morally sound and fiscally responsible thing to do

173,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,In isolation I struggle with how this can be done and not viewed as a redistribution from those who either never went to college or who have already paid off their debt What seems missing from this debate is that the former students with the debt chose to sign up for it Structurally I would want a long ramp transition from debt fueled education to investment fueled education There are experiments like this happening where students sign up to pay a capped percentage of their income for a period of time into the university investment trust This flips the responsibility and burden from the students to the universities ability to educate and help create the most profitable students possible
174,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,agree Debt forgiveness sounds good as it s just voting money out of the public coffers It s certainly easy and expensive But then what Instead let s get college costs down Let s stop these text book scams Let s provide scholarships for people going to college for needed positions nurses teachers
175,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Ironically the loans themselves are the problem If we cancel student debt and ban the government from loaning money or guaranteeing loans maybe that would make sense

178,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The quality of education has changed Perhaps not in the ways one might think Firstly university is much more accessible now than it ever has been despite the costs Students are awarded more opportunities for experience and hands on work More fields and specializations are available That requires more work from professors or more accurately instructors More programs are available to students to help with their studies Writing Centers receive much more funding than they ever did as well as other learning center programs Programs for the health of students have been introduced since the s such as on site nursing and mental health aid We can make the costs of the university go down but that will require us to remove a HUGE amount of services that would make university much much less accessible available and useful All that to say singular schools would be much better equipped to deal with their own spending problems Administrations have more say over their budgets than anyone and WOW do many administrations waste a ton of money
179,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes Im fine with the loan forgiveness if we fix the underlying problem Putting a bandaid on it may help me out personally but its not going to help everyone going to school in the coming years
180,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This is an imperfect metaphor because changing that system is going to take forever if it ever happens and in the meantime millions sure could use that bandaid Because here s the thing for a lot of people that s not a bandaid it s a lifeline A lifeline that happens to goose the economy too
181,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I agree with radically changing the system but that takes time and a majority of representatives to agree on what needs to be done AND the appropriate fixes To tell someone to wait for these circumstances to align while they struggle with debt because it wont actually fix the problem sounds pretty shitty Maybe those that dont have debt have manageable debt can be patient for reform but many people cant

189,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,In my opinion this is far bigger priority With all the tall about debt forgiveness higher minimum wages etc People think throwing water out of these sinking boats will accomplish something and it wont Before we raise minimum wage first lets address why the cost of living is so damn high Before we throw money at debt lets figure out why tuition is so high and bring it down People think throwing money at these problems will fix them but it obviously wont

191,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,A trillion bailout is not a band aid Its real money that would immediately work as a stimulus for the economy Will it solve the long term problem Of course not No smart person would suggest it is but why is it so difficult to conceive of a problem which is fixed in multiple steps Even if we do fix it what of the entire generation of students who got screwed over by a predatory educational system Just unlucky to be born between and Everyone always says that they dont want to pay for X thing they dont immediately benefit from Its natural selfish and short sighted I dont think my federal tax dollars in CO should go to fund roads in Wyoming or dams in New Orleans No one should live in Wyoming or beneath sea level in NOLA according to me Nevertheless as a country sometimes we fix other peoples problems for the good of the whole
192,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This could be said of pretty much anything everything related to our economy at large If you look at the value of the dollar over time wages salaries and productivity it all was on a steady upward growth cycle for the most part until and then BOOM It all started to slowly crash and then flat line and stagnate Take minimum wage for example I know it can be a controversial topic sometimes but if it had kept up with inflation and the increase in worker productivity ever notice how jobs are having person do the job that people used to do it would be over hour now Then look at the prices of goods services College tuition for example since were on the subject wow It took me years for undergrad at my university back in the early s and it was around total for that time Now Its PER SEMESTER K per year That is simply ridiculous IMO Something has to be done about this our economy and wages in general The way things are going it is literally unsustainable If it keeps up eventually no one will be able to afford anything

195,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The problem started when the federal government stepped in to grant students loans and lobbyist allowed college debt to follow you even if you declare bankruptcy If the federal government is no longer involved then students would not be given absorbent loans for degrees that will obviously never get a return on the loan therefore lowering the cost of college in general
196,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Because everyone takes money out of education funding
197,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I don t disagree that root causes need to be addressed but tiny band aid seems like a mis characterization of this solution This is a lot of money for a lot of people that will just remove debts that have been or have the potential to follow people around for decades
198,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,In the s and s union jobs were common without a degree Those dont exist anymore Not in the numbers needed So more and more people are getting degrees driving up cost I always hear about people saying how expensive school is but not a single person is talking about what to do about it State schools are affordable Technical colleges are affordable People need to be responsible with their lives and not take on more debt than they can afford by going to a school they cant afford The solutions to massive student debt are all right there in front of them yet they choose to ignore it
199,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Well yes but the outcomes that are these massive debt burdens should be relieved The debt has the bigger real consequence than the system that created it imo
200,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,That tiny band aid would be a life changing event for actual real live people How about we just do both at once Can we handle that
201,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Exactly If we forgive the debt the problem is going to come back in a few years time so instead we probably need at minimize the amount of interest that goes onto student loans especially if the answer isnt going to be something along the lines of a free college program which for whatever reason will be difficult to get through Congress but possible on the State level in some places So I would start by recommending a student loan interest cap on all federal student loans The idea is you have a number that is some percentage of the actual student loan you get lets say to keep it easy and when you accrue a lifetime interest of of that loan no more interest is accrued and then you pay back the loan as normal without having to worry about gathering any additional interest With this you are able to keep most of the existing infrastructure in place and because there would be a cap in place to keep student debt from going completely out of control income based repayment becomes a real and viable option for actually paying off student loans There is probably going to be a need to cap the interest on existing federal loans that are way past any cap percentage that anyone would recommend that way there would at least be an end in sight for a lot of these borrowers Obviously I think this would need to be done alongside other major changes like addressing textbooks for profit colleges free tuition alongside other wider reaching changes like increases to minimum wage This is just a suggestion I have been thinking about because I know I personally have done well under the current system but I have done so while certain individuals have suffered greatly from absolutely crippling debt This is just a way to fix the system and not getting rid of all of the jobs and positions that currently exist now because of the system and can serve as a stepping stone to eventually phase the system out entirely when its possible
202,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,While I agree that the system needs to be fixed if I get stabbed I would still like the EMTs to try and stop the bleeding before they give me a CT scan to see if any vital organs were punctured Debt forgiveness while not a fix does give complete relief to million Americans and I can get behind helping of the country while we work on a real long term solution to the education issues we have in this country
203,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,YES Thank god this is the top comment I m all for college debt forgiveness I do not have college debt but it s not fair to the subsequent generations year olds now who will begin amassing the exact same debt going forward
204,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Ill start with saying I completely agree My question is what exactly can legistlated to fix this What parts of the college education cost can be regulated enough to make a difference Thats the question I personally struggle with even as a proponent of this idea
205,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,All of these problems can be boiled down to one phenomenon the rise of the administrator Universities are exponentially more expensive now because universities became businesses somewhere down the line and businesses need administrators But universities are not meant to be businesses and indeed the business model runs contrary to at least one of the university s missions which is the impartial awarding of grades on the basis of merit That s hard enough to achieve in a merit centric model but when your students are literally paying customers it becomes disincentivized outright So they hire more and more admins to fill ever multiplying marketing niches essentially It s no wonder most of our universities have become sports teams with schools attached having a good team is great marketing So another utterly predictable side effect of this is that profs are encouraged to go easy on college athletes Did they do C work Then maybe we should consider awarding them a B or change a b to a B ad infinitum And the predictable side effect of that is that grades increasingly fail to reflect the quality of one s actual work This way of organizing education is counterproductive and as we can all plainly see unsustainable So we can reform higher education now by ripping the bandaid off and mandating the removal of all nonessential administrators a solution that would do immense short term harm to those whose livelihoods are found in university administration or wait for the system to collapse under the weight of its own overhead The problem with waiting is that in the meantime costs will continue to rise and graduation will become more and more dependent on income This will obviously exacerbate income inequality even more as hard as that might be to imagine
206,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yes exactly The reason for the increase in costs is due to government backed student loans coupled with bloated administrative costs These types of loans allowed colleges to charge increasingly more money with the knowledge that students will pay because the government will be backing these loans Students take on high levels of debt and there is no incentive to decrease tuition because the demand is still high for the those loans
207,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Both debt relief and college affordability are good ideas Why not have both One does not cancel the other Debt relief for my wife and affordable college for my daughter
208,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I do agree with you entirely I m just going to play the devils advocate for a second One of the common explanations for why colleges and universities have become more expensive over the years is because while the quality of the education has not increased the quality of the facilities have increased Better dorms lab equipment gym equipment common areas relaxation spots etc have played into the rising cost because those things are expensive to build and maintain and the students get access to them while there So would it be worth it to get rid of these facility improvements some or all in order to help reduce tuitions For now let s focus on this topic exclusively I know there is a whole menagerie of issues that drive up costs but I m interested on y all s opinion of this

217,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Ive been emailing tweeting writing everyone I can think of my senators representative Joe Bidens office the incoming Secretary of Education Elizabeth Warren etc about this My interest rates across my various federal loans average so that I too have paid more than half the amount I borrowed but the vast majority has gone towards interest rather than principal Lowering interest rates in order to empower borrowers to actually repay our loans strikes a decent balance between much needed assistance which doubles as economic stimulus when loans are able to be repaid and our money then spent elsewhere and the complaints that outright forgiveness is unfair to those who have already finished paying off their loans Lower them for all federal loan holders not just undergraduates as Ive seen proposals for forgiveness doing My expensive professional degree has provided me with a decent income let me spend it uplifting my community rather than in this interest black hole Edit I also mention that eliminating the tax hit on any amount remaining after an income based repayment plans term is over would be hugely beneficial
218,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Just want to chime in from a European perspective thats how educational loans work in a number of countries here Germany has a system where you get an allowance based on your parents income nowadays the max is You cant acrue more then k of debt you still get your allowance but everything beyond k is a gift and only half of your allowance is counted towards the debt anyways And those k are interest free you have to start paying back five years after your studies have ended and only if you are not unemployed or earn below a certain threshold If Im not mistaken the Scandinavian countries have a system where the amount does not depend on your parents income and you only have to start paying back once you earn more than a certain amount of money
219,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The interest is high because its ostensibly an unsecured loan There is no physical collateral to repossess to get the lenders money back Except student loan debt is unbankruptable The only way to shake it is to pay it off or die So with that in mind the interest rate is and has been too high for years It over estimates the risk I can get a car loan for interest and even though its an asset its an asset that depreciates like a falling rock and could be all but wiped out in value by a fender bender and its bankruptable on top of that How is an unbankruptable student loan that much larger risk

232,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Ive tried to make that point but that poster hit it spot on They said it in a much more convincing way Essentially to forgive student loan debt for every debtor would be a grossly inequitable policy Just as that post points out there are many who did not assume the burden of debt who will be shafted Whats worse many of the debtors who suddenly are relieved of their debt burden get a substantial leg up in wealth building over so many others who either never took on debt or who already paid it off I wont go through the example Ive used before but in basic terms over time the elimination of say monthly loan payment will go a long way for young recent graduates to leap older more temporally distant graduates in wealth building Likewise a college graduates income ceiling is generally much greater than a non college graduate In other words not only will the college graduate earn more money in their lifetime but the short term financial sacrifice necessary to achieve that would be eliminated The long term effects of such an inequitable policy are almost never discussed and maybe not seriously considered There are other ways to help people who are truly struggling with no light at the end of the tunnel For one as many others have commented reduce interest rates so the monthly payment applies to nearly all of the principal Another make it easier to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy and include legal safeguards to protect against debtors feigning poverty to get the benefit of bankruptcy There is no doubt that student loan debt is problem But simply discharging debt for every borrower is not an equitable solution

244,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I slightly disagree because I took out student loans since I had no other option to pay for school and I m not privileged or rich I lose funding for financial aid the minute we won t over k yr and we don t make much more I don t have thousands sitting around to pay the tuition and I also don t live somewhere that has a lot of job opportunities But I do think that it s a slap in the face for those of us who live frugal and watch out spending expenses so we can pay these loans back What about us current students who will still have k to repay after we are done Where s our forgiveness If they forgive k I would definitely switch to the Republican Party and vote red
245,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,going to cheap state schools instead of top tier ones Unfortunately even cheap state schools are outrageously expensive For me there was no cost difference between a state school and a private school because state schools are so expensive where I live Ive been attending a cheap online university while working full time lately because I actively chose to avoid student loans Im paying my own way upfront I wish I had this option Unfortunately college costs have gotten to the point where its basically impossible to make enough money to pay it up front loans are pretty much inevitable Minimum wage is where I live non minimum wage jobs dont pay much better In other words its not that A already suffered and got theirs while B is suffering Its that A got their reward no debt and B got theirs meaningful university experience and now B wants to get As reward too This is way too simple for this kind of situation We need to look at the material effect of massive student loan debt and astronomical college costs on the population Many people with degrees are severely underpaid but have more debt despite these low wages This leads to delays in starting their careers moving out on their own buying a house and even having children in the future if thats what they want Theres lots of people my age who want to have children but have come to the realization that they most likely wont be financially stable enough to have children I dont want children personally but Ive realized I will most likely never be able to buy a house I am far from alone Many people dont go to the doctor when something is wrong which of course often leads to worse health outcomes later down the line Theres speculation that millennials will be the first generation to not have a longer life expectancy than their parents generation Suicide rates are up amongst Gen Z I dont think it takes a genius to figure out just how bad all of this is for the economy and society overall And then throw a climate crisis on top of all this So this notion that people who went to college and took out loans to do so didnt have to make sacrifices or put their life on hold is bullshit It is a very poor understanding of the situation we are in as a society I graduated not even years ago and I already feel like my life is over Its not going to get better We need to do SOMETHING because things are about to get real bad Forgive or whatever amount Abolish the interest rates erase interest amounts from balances and apply interest payments already made towards the principal amount Automatically forgive after years no matter what Make it possible to declare bankruptcy on student loans private ones too if you cant declare bankruptcy on them Legislation to control college costs Free community college Free healthcare and more legislation for workers protections too while were at it And maybe some legislation addressing housing costs I dont want anyone else to suffer like this We cant just sit here and do nothing
246,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The problem is this Colleges charge as much as they think they can get away with charging because People are okay with paying that amount of money because College loans are so heavily subsidized that there s not enough actual cost because Colleges charge as much hm IMO what needs to happen is the government needs to stop giving students cheap loans and student loans need to stop being exempt from discharge under bankruptcy Private loans especially with the added risk of bankruptcy are more expensive so the real cost of college loans rises More people decide it s a raw deal and opt out of college for trade schools or entrepreneurship and such College demand drops and it s cost follows Also hopefully having fewer people with silly extraneous degrees running around will force employers to realize that they don t really mean that much and so demand for degrees will drop even further
247,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Students really dont have a choice when it comes to getting the most for their money as a typical undergrad will have to go thru years of basic classes that either do not pertain to their major and or are things they already had in HS Sure they do Community college teaches all of those same classes for a small fraction of the price On top of that a lot of states have programs that allow community college grads to easily transfer to any public school in the same state to earn their BS BA We absolutely have a choice in the matter and there is a lower barrier of entry for that route than most state funded year schools
248,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I strongly disagree with the first two paragraphs my college nominally requires its students to spend approximately of the units that a typical student is expected to take on general education requirements but in practice it is easy to load many of these requirements into one s freshman year eg by taking or classes at once when the recommended course load is thereby freeing up space later to take useful courses In addition AP and IB credit and CC classes can be really helpful in escaping breadth requirements Secondly while textbooks have a high price pirating textbooks has never been easier For the flip side of digitization is that when everything is online it s much easier to get it for free Also textbooks are only a small fraction of the cost of school my public university costs K per year but only K is expected to be spent annually on textbooks I d imagine that for private universities the proportion is even smaller I definitely agree on the increases in loans being mostly absorbed by increases in tuition though

255,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This is something I have commented on elsewhere and I agree with you I havent thought of it in electoral terms but it is in a sense a regressive policy It is essentially an enormous cash transfer to the upper middle and upper classes with no corresponding benefit to anyone else College costs are too high by far but the fact is that people with a degree and the loans to prove it are far better off than those without one You would be giving up to k to every household that is already working white collar jobs and making a decent income while giving or k or whatever amount of debt they happen to hold to households with no degree holders or people who went to cheap schools This would be absolutely terrible for the Democratic Party imagine the image of Joe the Plumber getting while the coastal liberals get k in assistance

279,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The reason college is so expensive is because it is so easy to get tens of thousands of dollars to pay for it Once again this is reddits favorite conspiracy on the subject but not actually true Heres a relevant article on the last decade and how misinformed most Americans are about it https www pbs org newshour education most americans dont realize state funding for higher ed fell by billions text State appropriations per full Dtime Executive Officers Association C of SHEEO A NY times article that also provides good information https www nytimes com interactive magazine high school seniors html Some quick takeaways from the links From alone States funding of their University systems declined an inflation adjusted billion dollars Considering the ish billion dollar estimate for free college for all its clear thats a hefty share in students paid for about of university costs By it rose to nearly half From to states cut their fiscal support for public higher education in the United States almost in half relative to personal income And lets keep in mind some states have done much more for higher education than most others In many states the picture is actually worse than it appears in this data So federally guaranteed loans might have given some comfort to state legislatures as they were eviscerating their higher ed budgets And theyve certainly given families the ability to borrow without proper regard for consequences But its high time Reddit catches up with the facts on this subject
280,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Great points I ll respond briefly of those with student loan debt don t have college degrees A cap of k or k would be much less regressive because the majority of student loan debt holders are lower middle class These individuals hold less debt per person than upper class folks with advanced degrees but they make up the majority of people with SL debt The prospect of taking on debt is a major barrier to educational attainment and upwards mobility so any relief could be packaged with reduced free tuition for future students i e free community college or two years of undergraduate
281,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Agreed on all fronts The main argument against the unqualified debt forgiveness is regressive position that Ive seen is increase to student debt doesnt causatively increase earning which is disingenuous in that it subtly but very significantly changes the basis of the discussion No nobody reasonable is saying taking out more debt makes you earn more Its the people youd be giving the money to with blanket forgiveness averaged and aggregated across the population need the money a lot less than other groups I dont really see that as fundamentally contentious and it should be a showstopper all by itself An incremental needs based payment assistance or even better payment credit program would make a lot more sense Below a certain income threshold and can prove you make a regular payment of some amount Great heres a rebate for of it Make a little more OK heres and the difference better be less than the income difference to avoid perverse incentive Left college to an immediate six figure job Sorry youre not getting much not that you dont deserve it you just dont need it as much as other people do I also think we need to acknowledge that yes theres an unfairness aspect to it Stop pretending there isnt Thats not the point we want to minimize unnecessary unfairness but were also not optimizing for individual fairness of outcome which would require way more and way more subjective of data than we have were instead optimizing for an overall economic benefit across the whole population And even then when you make it needs based its still going to be true that the neediest of graduates are still going to be a lot less needy than of some other groups Whether or not thats a blocker is up for debate remember overall impact not individual fairness but it needs to be brought into the discussion Ive made a very comfortable income ever since and with internships even before my graduation Part of that is being strategic about my choice of curriculum and field but part of it is and always will be just good luck I wouldnt have been at all selfishly upset about being thrown extra money but thatd have been an absolutely idiotic thing from a holistic perspective I never had to struggle and the money wouldve in all likelihood just sunk straight into long term investment vehicles and done little to nothing for the economy
282,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The biggest arguments for cancelling federal student debt in my opinion are both bc it would be good for the economy as a whole Free up debt service money to go into the rest of the economy kinda already happening since loans are on hold Every dollar spent on education returns more to the country and more tax revenue to the government than investing in almost anything else This https www bostonfed org media Documents cb PDF Trostel invest in higher ed pdf report is a little old but states the government gets back over in increased future tax revenue and decreased future government assistance for every dollar spent It makes economic sense to make all federal student aid into grants rather than loans as the government is already recouping its investment and then some no matter what it s among the cheapest forms of economic stimulus since it s just writing off debt that s on the books It doesn t actually cost the government much of anything in terms of cash out the door only lost future interest revenue I agree cancelling debt is a band aid for the larger issue of skyrocketing costs for higher education however it makes a lot of economic sense to do it
283,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I have to agree that money could be put towards a lot of better things Green New Deal for one That could cut greenhouse emissions and create a lot of jobs
284,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Third it s a terrible stimulus It s beubg sold as one but clearing someone s balance sheet has a fractional impact on increasing cash flow Thus for the amount of money being spend it is a bad stimulus This part I have to disagree with It s far and away the best idea for a stimulus we ve had One time small checks get spent or saved almost immediately For those who are living paycheck to paycheck that money is in and out That rapid velocity of money is what drives economies When you said clearing someone s balance sheet has a fractional impact on increasing cash flow my mind went think about it What is a balance sheet balancing Liabilities and assets If you clear the liabilities or k of them where does that money go To the asset side You re absolutely freeing up significant cash flow which to my point earlier gets spent on things like dinners out new cars recreation travel housing all things that drive the economy by increasing the velocity of money Example if I have k in federal loans I m probably paying roughly a month Now I would have that much extra to spend elsewhere or save This generation with their significant student loan debt is something we haven t dealt with before The system is fundamentally broken and is preying on easy borrowing from the fed to jack tuition which increases unexpongable student debt It needs to be fixed stat The economy is stalling out because an entire generation can hardly afford necessities like housing and a car because they now have this third category of debt We re seeing vast amounts of wealth being transferred through piss poor economic policy and a steadfast devotion for a debunked theory of trickle down economics and as that s happening so too are our children being saddle bagged with this debt is going to cause economic boom and bust cycles to happen faster and faster and faster until we fix it Is forgiving k alone going to fix it No But it needs to happen IN CONJUNCTION with sweeping changes to the system such as tuition rates locking in interest on federal loans increase in scholarship and grant awards and the dismantling of for profit colleges

287,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I would say that a blanket k reduction would piss off too many people and I think thats the real reason Biden is holding off on it Also there are other ways to forgive student debt without pissing people off Like if a person works in a low paying social service type profession and gives up some of their best years to get ahead that person should automatically have all of their loans forgiven I also think those loans should have extremely low interest rates with each payment paying off mostly the principal like you said

340,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Part of the problem is that our public universities do so much more than just education for the students My local state university runs the biggest art museum in the region It is also the primary research institution and provides essential historical archival services as well The university library is open to the public and anyone is able to apply for a library card to check out materials All lf these services are free to the public save the art museum More than that a major university such as that one attracts businesses who need a reliable supply of trained people to hire Research institutions all the more so because research students are critical to R D firms The services a university provides drives the major part of just about any regional economy and yet no part of the government treats universities like the dynamos they are With the exception of grant money which does not cover salaries this is all paid for by tuition and other fees

345,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Saying that the loans themselves are the problem ignores the decades of defunding of public universities by state governments
346,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,the loans themselves are the problem This is commonly repeated but not really or at least primarily true The biggest change in the last yeas has been the massive cuts to higher education funding by the states themselves Over the years most states have steadily shifted the burden of funding their university systems off their budgets and onto the students Guaranteed loans may have made some states more comfortable in that approach but ending federal loans would not magically make universities cost less Nor would it compel states to begin properly funding higher education again The biggest impact would be a lot of poorer students would no longer have access to higher education and thats not the solution anyone wants

351,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,To tell someone to wait for these circumstances to align while they struggle with debt because it wont actually fix the problem sounds pretty shitty I dont think anyone here is telling people they should wait to pay off debt Im certainly not If people were in essence defrauded then they should be given a chance to be made whole by the legal system That being said this is a small portion overall of people who would benefit from a blanket loan forgiveness program I think the answer for everyone else with the debt is for them to work within the capitalist system and pay it off

363,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I think a loan with an interest rate tied to the national inflation rate coupled with a low administrative fee and a penalty for late payment makes more sense economically Because of inflation today is worth more than in years Im not an economist but I have to imagine that billions of dollars in loans that pay themselves off over time would be problematic Tying the interest rate to inflation would make the loans super low interest ensure the money remains at the same value over time and stop the most predatory lending practices
364,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Because the car may be a depreciating asset but at least it can be repossessed by the lender for of the value of the loan A student loan may not be dischargeable in bankruptcy but that doesnt mean the student is actually going to pay it Keeping the student responsible for the loan doesnt help the lender at all if they just cant or dont pay You cant get blood from a stone

369,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I think theres a decent argument to be made that college grads with high levels of debt represent one of the best targets for a one time stimulus They are on average higher income but constrained by high debt and reducing or eliminating that debt would add significant amounts of spending too the economy as a whole That said I have a very real concern on how that looks to people who never went to college who suddenly see their taxes explicitly bailing out higher income earners I think its a better idea than the recent tax cuts but its also a much much harder sell

408,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This point fails to deal with one of the biggest issues to my mind with debt forgiveness which is that the people whose debt would be forgiven are often in direct competition in the market against people without debt Maybe having more young middle to upper middle class professionals with high buying power purchasing homes and spending money is good for the economy as a whole I understand this stimulus idea of debt relief But I do not think it is the rising tide lifts all boats scenario some proponents have made it out to be rather its a rising tide that benefits the people already in a position to take advantage of the economic upturn at the expense of some others Say you are a pest control technician who did not go to college You make decent money and are close to saving enough for the downpayment on a single family home Now say student debt is forgiven College grads who still have significant debt that forced them to delay buying a home suddenly no longer have that issue They become your direct competitor in the housing market ultimately with their much higher lifetime earning potential these grads drive home prices in your small city up and you are essentially forced out Now from a foot view this scenario looks attractive Money is flowing the housing market is booming it seems like debt forgiveness was a boon to the economy as a whole But it neglects the people whose tax dollars essentially went towards decreasing their purchasing power
409,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,its preventing lots of the younger generations from building savings for unemployment or retirement purchasing houses doing preventative medical care having children I think student debt is a very small part of that I was lucky to have my college paid for by an inheritance but I still cant really afford any of those Im in my s I have a good degree and an above average job Im not suffering like many but Ive all but given up on owning a house and Im worried about having children My savings are enough to maybe weather an emergency but having enough money to live on for years without working seems like voodoo math to me

413,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,COLLEGE as an institution serves significantly middle class and up folks Therefore just those entering it are much wealthier than average Then the fact is college degrees cause people to make significantly more money than not By forgiving random amounts of student loans you are subsidizing people who not only are far wealthier on average but also people who in most cases have college degrees It also does nothing to address the root issue I can hardly think of a worse policy for this amount of money
414,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its like the Trump tax cuts Yeah poor people get some savings but we all saw where the bulk of the benefits went
415,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,You do realize this is your anecdotal evidence People are classified as middle and upper class by income not net worth And people making middle to upper class income typically have a college education exceptions to every rule like celebrity and such So providing student loan forgiveness is a handout to people who make above average income There are many studies on the value of a college degree and it increases salaries by a double digit percentage I am on mobile otherwise I would link some sources and provide a exact percentage

433,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Thats just more trickle down economics In reality all of the people who paid their loans off or paid for their schooling with cash will now have to compete with more buyers in the market place for major things like homes and cars Expect this crazy housing market to get a hell of a lot crazier if student debts are forgiven That makes sense to get more people educated and make college cheaper Its ex post facto in regard to blanket forgiveness though It costs the same as giving out cash We are already operating under a deficit and this would increase the deficit even more That means we either need to print more other people will lose buying power to inflation cut other programs or raise taxes
434,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I think he means that it s a terrible economic stimulus in that the government is essentially taking on k of debt and only receiving a couple of hundred dollars of potential additional spending in return each month going forward Since many of the people getting the forgiveness would be relatively high income there s a decent chance a portion of that wouldn t even be spent at all but saved If the government is going to take on k of debt in order to stimulate the economy it would probably make more sense to use it in a way so that it gets entirely or mostly back into the economy right away
435,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,You seem to understand what I am saying though would be only a month That s not a huge cash flow change Over say the more months of Corona you re talking of the given out in cash flow terms And it s actually less than that because loan interest and payments are suspended until Sept nobody has to pay right now You re not doing as much with the TRILLON dollars as you could

451,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If Im the only one you see with this comment theres a lot of the discussion you havent read I also acknowledged that this was just treating a symptom which should also clarify that I dont think its solving the root problem But if it needs to be clarified more bluntly k forgiveness doesnt solve the deeper problem While it would be a nice way to somewhat make up for that problem the problem still needs to be fixed so that we dont reach a point where a mere k forgiveness doesnt have such a massive impact on of the country

454,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Transferring it to a minority that does need it though A tax cut would be better but Biden has to negotiate with other people to get that done and it would have to be a lot to match that million person stimulus
455,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,True cutting taxes on people making lowered wages would be good like doubling the basic standard of living deduction which was done and I benefited from that with a one time not monthly dollars Killing those student loan payments would be a much bigger stimulus over time and benefit those who devoted themselves to their education which is the same reason it is wise to fund education and the same reason success stories from those graduates are still valuable It reinforces that education itself is a good thing in the mind of the public because later education will have seemed to work even if only in contrast to not education And of course many of these graduates are unemployed and are desperate due to Covid that debt repayment would be a huge relief to them one that they d normally only get through due to bankruptcy anyway but the law doesn t allow them to Morally and monetarily in terms of economic stimulus waiving student loan debt gives that group of the population a back pay of covid relief in the worst case and then a payoff in the best case Anyone doing so well they didn t need that monthly debt relief would have already paid it off Vanishingly few people would be in the range of heavily benefiting the taxpayer And again we had a tax cut come into effect this year The base deduction was doubled k to k A cut obviously targeted to the poirest of the population I d gladly agree with a bigger tax cut here say no tax with a k deduction But I d want no taxes under k Which would mean the cap for social security taxes to move up from k to k preferably higher enough to increase rather than decrease SS income And move all the tax brackets beyond the first up by so many k focusing on the higher brackets that tax income increases not decreases Then you have a society that doesn t tax the lower class anymore and doesn t that sound great And talk about economic stimulus that s as much as k per month per person for the lower middle class up to k per year It benefits you less the less money you make of course and more the more you make until you get rich enough the tax savings aren t relevant to your day to day life k a month is pretty big for me don t know about you Of course realistically we need to raise the highest tax bracket The top one percent already pays of all taxes paid and they are at their lowest tax rate in decades A minor increase in them combined with a big relief to the lower middle class would be a better stimulus hands down If you have a job of course If you don t you can bankruptcy for skip out of any inescapable debt ohhhh except student loans sorry those are somehow more important than say emergency room bills or property tax which is settled when they take the property or literally any other debt you owe Instead the government placed investor risk with public risk for capitalist lenders Guaranteed percentage return loans How insane is that Here I am looking at what stocks to invest in to hopefully retire and big banks can just guarantee income under penalty of law Capitalism is the direct enemy of a functioning economy with respect to the incentives placed on democrats and republicans Republicans represent the rich who do not want taxes raised on them and the poor who have been convinced to believe that raising taxes on the rich is unfair even though the rich would never feel it in their daily lives Democrats represent business interests which would benefit from economic stimulus and see the tax cuts and stimulus as benefitting those businesses Passing a tax cut of the magnitude comparable to waiving all those student loans is not really thinkable without blowing up the national debt or getting a majority to believe we need to raise taxes That s why I would advocate for more progressive democrats over liberals too In the meantime though yeah let Biden put a bandage on things until progressive democrats over liberal democrats have an advantage and democrats as a whole are the majority so they can pass bills without fighting the filibuster and maybe even without percent party agreement Doing enough shouldn t mean no one thinks you are doing too much after all https taxfoundation org summary of the latest federal income tax data update

466,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Putting money in the hands of the consumer boosts the economy Public works projects have done that in the past If the people have money they put it into the economy they buy things It sure is a lot better than giving trillions to the people at the top Corporations put up record profits that go into a very limited number of pockets Hedge funds get rich in the short term then the hyper inflated market collapse hedge funds short the market get even richer In the meantime a college grad who is working a good job but is still not able to support a family or buy a house is struggling to pay off their student loans If the government is going to hand money out to boost the economy it is better done by giving it to the working class than the corporations that just hoard money I dont mind paying back my loans but it is hard with such a high interest rate I think a better long term approach would be to get rid of interest or at least lower it drastically so that people can pay their student loans easier and faster

497,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I really dont see why we treat college differently than K public education anyway At maximum an individual should be paying for room and board and the food plan The government already has a template for how free college could work in the way primary and secondary school works and a marginal tax on the rich would pay for extending those programs through undergrad In the meantime k in loan forgiveness to the average college educated person would wipe out all or most of their debt and if theyre not spending to or more every month trying to keep Navient satisfied that money is still going to go somewhere I think you would see a lot of people suddenly buying cars and houses within the next years if they could recoup that income instead of throwing it at a bill whose benefits post graduation are effectively imaginary Really with the status quo we have some people are walking around with masters and doctorates and are still incapable of affording an apartment without roommates years or more after graduating I mean if you can have a doctorate in psychology and have less money in your pocket after bills than a general manager at McDonalds how is the current system beneficial to you I think the short end economic impact of depriving the federal government of that money would be negligible while the long term benefits for ordinary people would be staggering

506,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I agree that graduate program students hold the most debt roughly of it Their debt often goes well above k so throwing money at their debt wouldnt resolve that issue However for the ish million people that have debt under k it would be a significant relief This could be the start of rebuilding a middle class I am of the contention that removing k of debt is more akin to an investment towards reforming the system
507,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I worded this poorly my apologies What Im trying to convey is the difference between removing the debt now vs not removing the debt and maybe slowly amending the system that allowed it to happen For many the choice is obvious That small portion is still roughly million people of the population Removing k of debt to me would be like an investment from the government signaling to the country that its serious about changing the system A down payment of sorts

585,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It wouldn t be cheaper bc the government would actually have to pay out of pocket the reason people talk about cancelling student debt but not those other kinds is because the government can actually do it pretty easily without a horrible budgetary impact It s not really an either or thing it s more about what is feasible
586,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I would argue that point makes itself If the govt takes on k of debt so that it s citizens could increase their cash flow and thus the velocity of money by mo x m people you re freeing up over b per month This b is then circulated through the economy Even if it is saved that would increase the liquidity of banks allowing them safer lending That b per month of economic activity would more than cover the cost of the trillion dollar investment over the life of the borrower another years if avg age is It would cover itself easily within years It s worth noting that the reasons stimulus checks work to both stimulate and steady the economy is because they increase the velocity of money This move would be doing that on a scale we haven t seen before Increasing the velocity of money by an increased b per month for the life of the borrower Most economists agree that student debt relief would make a measurable immediate and long lasting impact on steadying our boom bust economy and strengthening the USD
587,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Alright let s assume your numbers are true and it would free up roughly per month if the k were forgiven The government spends T to do that There s about m American student debt holders let s assume equal impact for arguments sake and each one sees the same benefit That s million people now seeing a mo benefit million x billion per month freed up in cash flow T program B increased cash flow roughly months or just over years in equated revenue The increased economic activity would result in far more tax revenue than the direct payments to the government because the benefit is lifelong where the loan balances had an expiry So now those m people buy homes property tax for life school tax or cars sales and auto tax or even just consumer goods sales tax which then props up businesses which employ people income tax and it holds the economy steady strengthening the USD In theory all of the benefits of trickle down economics only this time they re real The velocity of money would increase which would stabilize the economy That s the whole point Not to mention the federal government is not in the student loan business to make a profit They are providing student loans to borrowers so that they can reap the economic and societal benefit of having a more educated and healthy workforce I m sure if you do the math student loan borrowers who have been paying their loans for years have already paid back their principle balance but because the interest rates are so high and interest is capped from distribution a staggering amount of interest is added to them As a government they do not and should not operate that service as a profit center That s not what governments do They provide services for their citizens to improve the economic societal and fundamental well being of their population Which is what this initiative would do

592,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I agree that loan forgiveness is not good policy and that the real issue is the overall cost of college however I think the solution should be more loans not less A Federal Loan at minimal interest rate should be offered for students who attend an in state public school Generally in state schools are much more affordable and a low interest will make those schools much more competitive will fancier private schools The competition for students between public private schools can then help lead to lower prices As a personal note because my Federal Loans capped out at a certain amount I believe at about interest rate I was forced to take out private loans near or at Would have loved an option to take out a low interest loan for staying in state

594,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I mean youre technically correct which I suppose is the best kind of correct but Congress wrote a specific law saying Student loan debts are not dischargeable in bankruptcy leaving behind an unusually small exception undue hardship U S C a B The exception is available only to individuals filing Chapter bankruptcy an unusual move only available to some individuals in the first place The exception isnt just some judge thinks paying your loans is an undue burden but rather some judge thinks that paying your loans will leave you eating cat food and that it will require you to keep eating cat food for most of the rest of the life of the loan Thats the Brunner test https law justia com cases federal appellate courts F The courts are okay with making you eat cat food for a while to pay back that loan just as long as its not tooooo long a time Yes the exception is in the statute so you are technically correct but it is explicitly supposed to be very difficult to reach that exception and hoo boy is it ever and so strikes me as fair to say that student loan debts are ordinarily not dischargeable

601,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,yeah right cuz cancelling debt and making education free wouldnt help the bottom earners If you cancelled say automotive debt then sure it could help bottom earners But cancelling education debt doesnt help people who dont hold education debt and the bottom quintile only holds of total student debt The top quintile holds of it SOURCE https www brookings edu blog up front who owes the most in student loans new data from the fed Having taxpayers pay for all education making it free to the recipient could help the bottom quintile as you suggest but that seems to me to be a separate topic but your original claim was much broader than that also teachers unions strike because theyre treated like shit christ have you been to chicago its a disaster As a matter of fact I have family in both the Chicago public school system and in the Milwaukee private school system The CPS teacher gets paid much better has far stronger benefits enjoys immense job security and has a wide range of additional supports unavailable to the private school teachers From my perspective theyre in the catbirds seat Their attempts to suck more from the taxpayers arteries seem to me to be aimed at helping themselves not Chicagos schoolkids who could benefit from more taxpayer dollars being spent on them directly rather than lavished on their teachers Of course this is only my anecdotal experience and others may have quite different experiences I myself am in a private school system in Minnesota far from Chicago although I thank all that is good every day that I have the financial resources to stay out of our dicey public school system and I wish everyone else did too as for in person education we shouldnt be allowing in person anything right now because of that big disease thats killing everybody I supported school closures in April May when we didnt know anything about the virus and had no serious defenses against it But we now know for a fact that schools that take relatively straightforward precautions masks social distancing frequent hand washing temperature checks mandatory isolation if exposed lunch in the classroom instead of the cafeteria etc can operate in person quite safely without spreading the virus even when virus levels in the community are very high See a UNICEF roundup https www cdc gov mmwr volumes wr mm e htm s cid mm e w or a fresh study out of Wisconsin https www cdc gov mmwr volumes wr mm e htm s cid mm e w among roughly one billion other easily googleable sources Combine this with the now well established fact that young kids are less vulnerable to COVID and far less likely to die of it if they catch it kids actually are more likely to die of the flu and its very difficult to justify continued school closures anywhere in the United States right now As a result pretty much every private school kid in America has been in person full time since September and so have public school kids in many states and theres simply no science showing that this is a problem The teachers unions however have dragged their feet about re opening I wont speculate on their motives only the conclusion they currently pose a threat to our childrens educations and on unscientific grounds Youre correct that private does not guarantee efficiency However there are some sectors where private enterprise promotes efficiency through competition and sometimes even outperforms less expensive public options Education appears to be one of them Notice that Im only saying schools should re open I am not saying that all covid restrictions everywhere should be repealed Some of them are still reasonable and science based Just not this one also those court cases are about compulsory attendance im not sure what that has to do with funding the school system You proposed abolishing private education Both those Supreme Court cases illustrate the principle that the state simply cant do that parental rights and religious rights trump state interest in standardized public education Indeed you seem to have misread Pierce v Society of Sisters it was about a law that abolished private education just as you suggest and the Supreme Court struck that law down as unconstitutional EDIT typo

693,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I agree with your first paragraph Totally agree that guaranteeing student loans has driven up tuition prices The federal govt can dictate public universities so cap tuition increases to a fixed percentage The govt probably can t do that re private schools So we can potentially do something about rising tuition at public schools At some point students and families need to understand it s on you if you choose to go to a private school Society doesn t need to hold the hands of students willfully choosing Notre Dame over Purdue Your second paragraph has one flaw Schools will cut low paying majors career paths Otherwise you would have to charge an education student much less than an engineering student How is that fair How do you deal with kids changing majors There is a portion of the population that feels liberal arts are worth funding that would certainly change I think schools can do a much better job of explaining how much loans will be to payback provide more info on graduation rates for majors etc Then again all that information can be found in full or partially through google or by asking those questions

713,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Absolutely Ive also known some people who took out student loans simply because the interest rates were lower than the returns on their investments For example I had a friend whose parents bought a house in the college town we lived in their daughter lived in the house for years while at school rent free she paid for school with loans parents got to rent out other rooms then after the years were up they sold the house for a tidy profit which more than erased the loans The diversity of experiences I think is just one reason why blindly paying off tens of thousands of dollars for everyone is misguided There is a lot of room for us to make giant reforms in how education is paid for and by whom Personally I wouldnt support debt forgiveness unless it comes with assurances that its not going to be abused and that the whole higher ed financing scheme is reworked In Germany for example where education is free its almost free at least parents who are able are obligated to pay for their adult children to get a higher education whether thats university or apprenticeship or whatever that means the parents have to pay rent insurance etc during this time period So the situation you mentioned cant happen
714,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This is true I got screwed over because everything was based on my parents income even though they didnt pay my tuition And my parents are just middle class not upper class or even upper middle class by any means There should be an option to have the FAFSA be based on the students income and if they enact something like that I want a fucking refund lmao
715,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Im sure you didnt comb through my comment history before saying that If you do youll find several comments I made last year where I stated I didnt want stimulus money Ive had a stable job throughout COVID and would have preferred the money to go to someone who needed it more The money is quite literally meant to be spent by everyone to stimulate the economy Its not meant to save everyone from poverty and eviction Youre viewing the payments with the wrong ideas in mind EVERYONE needs everyone to spend because like of our economy is based on consumer spending As a matter of fact I fall into neither of those categories I went to college and I dont have student debt So neither option would directly benefit me Im in the same boat but I think the higher interest rates are ridiculous and the government should definitely not be making money on student loans I also think relieving the first k for everyone would catch those who went to CC or started at a year but didnt graduate and whose earnings dont benefit from their degree is a reasonable way to stimulate the economy further Anyway your reasoning in your OP was that it would alienate everyone who doesnt have college debt That suggests serious negative feelings if not anger Again the point of the move would be to stimulate the entire economy by directly putting money into pockets of consumers Also its something the president can do without the Senate Im sure there are better and fairer ways to stimulate the economy but will they survive the filibuster Youre stuck on worrying about the fairness of who gets what on a micro level meanwhile the entire economy is going to take forever to come out of the COVID funk if something isnt done

733,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Whats your point though What youve said is true but people that hold large amounts of student loan debt those that would benefit most from k relief are people that got their degree and thus have a higher earning potential In other words if youve made it through college you likely arent a lower income earner anymore
734,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Agreed The CC or trade school students are often forgotten in these conversations That actually brings up an interesting point though What if the forgiveness was limited to years redeemable after graduation Then those that stay with community college or a basic trade school get a benefit right away while those that continue to a year degree get a benefit later on It also incentives completion of schooling
735,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Poorer folks at ivy leagues get full rides almost entirely They qualify for cal grants etc And if that were the situation the solution would be grants at the source not one time debt forgiveness This is another classic example of leftists thinking a policy that at large does nothing for the lower class is somehow supporting the people The data just isn t there

755,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,You and I are going to disagree on this I feel that financial predators should not be allowed in education I feel that college should be on the same level as high school with regards to out of pocket costs IF the attainment of a degree was limited to just those classes that have a direct relationship to that degree then I might lean your way But they aren t Most US colleges require freshman to live on campus at exorbitant fees They require classes to be taken that have nothing to do with the reason the student is there Even the required books are often a scam in which professors put out new editions with only minor word changes in order to eliminate potential cost savings In short that entire industry is fucked up and this isn t even getting into how the money lenders operate So if we as a society are going to place a high value on a college degree then I believe that we as a society need to figure out a way in which its attainment doesn t put a yoke around the necks of those going down that path

767,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,They can be trained without a Bachelors degree if Bachelors become rarer companies will adjust pretty quickly Besides that a lot of the jobs youre talking about are the ones people need to go to college for then and now but we have so many going now the Bachelors is worth less and many end up working retail or service industry I worked in a kitchen with college graduates is that remotely necessary Obviously chemists and accountants will continue to go but we send far more people to college now than we need chemists or accountants Its why people have views that some degrees are useless theyre not at all we just get degrees in them for every jobs If you expand the number of people who go to college all you do is Bachelors become high school diplomas a lot of money is transferred to the college admins and Target is asking for Bachelors to work a register making people wait years to start earning
768,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Well of course people in construction dont need college degrees Thats a bit obtuse since your coworkers arent out trying to be accountants or doctors
769,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Im not sure the plan we have now which is going to be what pay higher taxes and wait until youre to really start working at Target because they want people with Bachelors to work the register as thats the new HS diploma is a better plan Yeah it may not appeal to voters that fewer people should go to college but its what we need
770,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It depends on what you want to do I like my job and it definitely requires a degree but many dont and theres not a real downside for streamlining education so people get the education they need and not just go because its expected If you dont need a degree for your job you absolutely made the right call not going The people I know who spent k interest to go get a job in retail is insane if youre ok with working that job great but dont waste time on a degree first

774,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Public schools are also to blame for this sometimes indirectly As long as loans are plentiful and easy to get states can say we cant afford to fund it just raise tuition And that doesnt always get passed along to student benefit but to admin and other costs The loans are an issue across the board People talk about the affordability of college back in the day which is true but also a lot fewer people went
775,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,And you have a robust trade school and apprenticeship program which offsets some of the demand for a year college degree
776,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Average student loan payment appears to be about month is a bit less than what I paid under my IRB and I was making figures
777,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I think neither I think making state universities free is best policy We still have functioning private schools in the K arena despite not charging exorbitant fees to parents for attendance at the public option We have federal standards for these schools and the states have a more direct hand in their operation Some states require stricter standards for public school than others and I imagine the same would be true of post secondary education if that model was used as a template Private schools would live and die on the basis of quality of education in relation to the free public option If anything this model would encourage private schools to increase their own standards in response to the state standard to stay relevant Maybe a few would die off but ultimately we wind up with a system that provides opportunities to go to college to whoever wants to encourages private schools to lower their prices and still allows those private schools the opportunity to stay relevant
778,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,entry college level stuff is pretty damn basic I never said it had to be for freshmen but its funny how you need to retake basic humanities and sciences to get a diploma think math English government history art music appreciation communications etc a lot of high school exit exams at least in my experience are done sophomore year you could essentially be doing those entry level courses in completing your degree your junior senior years in high school that wont fly though because then unis cant get the funding for it who needs AP courses when youre already doing the work youre gonna redo anyway

788,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its not entrapment It has more in common with grooming Yes theres nothing sexual about it but weve raised a generation of young people to believe in something and they were able to be taken advantage of because of their belief in that They were taught from a young age that going to a good college the best university you could get into was the path to living the best life This was reinforced by their parents teachers and most any forms of guidance in their life So unsurprisingly a lot of young people raised this way did as they were told and went to expensive universities For years there was no conversation about education being overcosted or student loans being predatory So now a large section of a generation is burdened with said debt and has little hope of ever owning a home The point isnt that a better decision couldnt have been made But we as a society were by and large not presenting young people the tools to seek success in any place other than college It seems silly to condemn year olds for not having more financial awareness than anyone advising them

790,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I mean you dont need to be in All that is required is a majority in the House Senate with reconciliation or a simple executive action in support of the Education Dept There appears to be growing support for this since it will stimulate the economy in the short and medium term Obviously long term solutions are required but thankfully the Democrats appear more interested in helping people now than virtue signaling Now one thing I should note money actually is created out of thin air every time a Treasury bond bill or note is issued money is created So long as USD comprise of all global currency reserves So long as its long term interest rates on its Treasury issuances is real negative the US can keep creating money out of thin air I dont know how much knowledge you have about how monetary policy actually works but you should really look into it

792,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Possibly not sure that outcome would be terrible though especially comparing to our current system I see nothing wrong with adding grades and youd still get a diploma after th potentially an associate degree after th Im curious what the arguments were regarding adding high school to compulsory education Im willing to bet wed see a lot of the same arguments on both sides lol E college wouldnt be compulsory though my feelings would probably be different if thats what they were proposing
793,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I have felt since I got my BA in the thick of the recession that this is how it should be I do feel that college is more than just a ticket to a better job and that the experience is integral BUT it is marketed as said ticket first and foremost I wish colleges and our education system made a concerted effort to show the benefits to society as a whole rather than just pushing the almost immediate financial pluses IF the correct field is chosen especially post recession Currently just pushing the financial gains from furthering your education is disingenuous on their part imo College for a large portion of people is NOT better for them FINANCIALLY College is much much more than just that a financial freedom gateway but not being as readily upfront about that is what makes them disengaging to me Plus bloated administration budgets at colleges across the country have contributed to the ridiculous cost of furthering ones education

797,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,It makes sense if you value educating the population You put the money toward education like you would roads or corn subsidies Most people that have problems with student loans dont care about the amount they owe They care that most of their payments go toward interest and the principle is barely touched If you think higher education is a brain washing operation conducted by the left then you are scared that any openness to education is a threat to your belief system
798,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Makes perfect sense if the loans are backed by the government or from the government
799,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Because right now the government collects interest in student loans and also collects higher tax revenues on average for the entire life of that college student They re really cashing in on both sides of the transaction
800,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Wait which country in Europe does it
801,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This isnt a bad idea Having mandatory payments tied to income that end after x years
802,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No Im just pointing out its entirely possibly to wipe out interest on federal loans The counter argument is no one would pay them back then And my counter counter argument is that the government for better or for worse currently does have the enforcement capabilities to make people pay them back just as they already do with taxes
803,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,What if it was structured so that the interest rate starts at or close to it but then it would go up by some amount for every missed payment
804,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Its not just about the interest An educated workforce is also one producing services As a private business if you issue a loan the only way you win is recouping the loan plus interest As the government there are other ways to win including a productive workforce that makes more money and pays back more taxes Higher wages equals higher taxes Theres more than one way to recoup that money
805,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Look what refugees from climate linkes famine in Syria has done to European politics recently The refugee debate is not the same in America as it is in Europe for us it is all about accepting Caribbean and Mexican refugees middle Eastern and African refugees are literally an ocean away We also dont have the same liberalized culture so theres not as much pushback to closing our borders Really though we should have been making sea walls an eternity ago Anyway my entire point was just that its not as drastic and issue in the United States as it is for other parts of the world which is why it isnt as Central to our politics as it is in the rest of the world
806,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I didnt dispute that costs rose Im saying state funding is every bit as relevant as federally backed loans
807,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I never claimed that these solutions were universally applicable almost no solution is so this is a ridiculously high bar and students still have the option of concentrating their breadth requirements into their freshman years I merely said that some options might be available than others I really don t know why you re choosing to claim that breadth classes disproportionately affect lower income students when your original reply implied you were in favor of them
808,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Otherwise you would have to charge an education student much less than an engineering student How is that fair They already do this My engineering degree at a state school was more a year than my wifes dual major liberal arts degree Why would it be fair for the liberal arts programs to pay for all of the labs and lab equipment
809,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,here is a portion of the population that feels liberal arts are worth funding that would certainly change Liberal Arts is an incredibly broad subject It covers Political Science and it also covers Music Therapy One of those requires a college education One of those will never pay off the student loan debt
810,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I also strongly disagree with any incentive to cut low paying degrees In many ways a liberal arts education is more important than all the others but because weve let markets dominate education here we are
811,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yeah Im not against people getting relief if theyve been in debt for decades and cant get out of it But there shouldnt be wealth redistribution towards the upper middle class
812,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,That something would be to either a raise taxes or b cut spending The question would be would this be a good use of public funds that is worth either a or b
813,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,If you dont pay your student loan the government can take your federal tax return or your social security benefits If people stop paying in mass that revenue would still not be made up especially if the reason is people are not employed I dont know the specifics of what percentages they are legally allowed to take

823,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I don t think that erasing debt is a good idea either We need to have a long term solution rather than this bandaid fix I m confused how the girl was able to secure federal loans though They re only given out to people whose family makes under a certain amount
824,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,No my category includes everyone who went to college and doesnt have any debt right now If your debt is almost gone then it means you would personally benefit from this going through wouldnt it K of benefit to be exact So what makes you think your opinion is the same as someone who only gets to deal with the negative consequences
825,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The money is quite literally meant to be spent by everyone to stimulate the economy Its not meant to save everyone from poverty and eviction Youre viewing the payments with the wrong ideas in mind I understand that completely However somebody somewhere NEEDED the I got I spent that money on a want The next person could have spent it on something they needed since they might have been out of a job I also think relieving the first k for everyone would catch those who went to CC or started at a year but didnt graduate and whose earnings dont benefit from their degree is a reasonable way to stimulate the economy further Speaking purely to stimulate the economy further it wouldnt A student debt freeze has been in place for almost a year now with no sign of being lifted Since these people arent putting the money towards paying down their student debt then theyre saving what they can and using the remainder to stimulate the economy Wiping out debt doesnt change the amount of money theyre using to stimulate the economy Theyre already at maximum efficiency For the rare individuals who are paying down their debt during the freeze lets just take their money and reinvest it in the next stimulus package I think the higher interest rates are ridiculous and the government should definitely not be making money on student loans completely agree Anyway your reasoning in your OP was that it would alienate everyone who doesnt have college debt Yes because that is already a very privileged group of people and as i mentioned above it doesnt actually accomplish the end goal of stimulating the economy Youre stuck on worrying about the fairness of who gets what on a micro level Were talking about T here That is macro level money going to a micro level cause specific to a small and already quite privileged portion of the democratic partys base while completely ignoring the under represented voters that came out in force in If they came out to vote and get shafted in stimulus dealings do you think theyre going to come back in and All Im saying is that if Im going to get taxed to support this I would much rather it be for the benefit of most of Americans

827,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I would love love love for you to explain to me how a poor non college educated vote for a party that cut taxes primarily on the rich is a vote in their interest Or any example of Republican voters voting based on their interest Especially considering they abandoned a party platform in the last election But mostly the taxes one cause thats really the only thing the Rs did legislatively when they had control of all chambers

835,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I dont think one number is sufficient Id like to see the average income growth on an individual level possibly broken down by major Part of the problem is that tons of people went to school because college opens doors only to find out that no only certain fields really open doors and their degree in a saturated field isnt going to help them at all

847,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Yeah that s pretty much the long and short of it We won t know what will happen until some sort of debt relief happens but the theory is yes the added cash flow monthly by the m borrowers that now have increased discretionary spending being recirculated through the economy would stimulate multiple market sectors most notably local consumer discretionary spending retail and grocery Which just so happens to be some of the hardest hit COVID sectors and have municipalities tax built in so win win If affording it is the issue we could fairly easily pay for this and net with ease by repealing the Trump tax cuts which have a net negative effect and add trillions more to the debt and increase taxes on middle class workers Moving the tax margins back to where they were before Reagan would be a good start Other options are to institute a trading tax on stocks federally decriminalize and make recreational marijuana taxable close glaringly large corporate tax loopholes and limit YOY loss rollover to years Markets are stimulated by increased activity Until people have more discretionary spending available that can t happen because too many people live paycheck to paycheck That would happen if you give them money or eliminate debt The one time payments haven t been very effective at stimulating the economy because those who needed it spent it and it s gone resulting in a short lived stimulant but flattening out because it s not enough and those who didn t saved it and it stagnates I think in order to justify the program you d have to identify the objective Is it to stimulate the economy It should work Is it to level load the balance sheets of m Americans so they have a chance at potentially not being the only generation in history declared to have a worse projected standard of living than their parents It would work Our economy cycles right now are growing closer and closer together and that s worrisome The black Monday bust under Reagan the dot com boom the real estate bubble the Great Recession the COVID crisis This is a result of a lack of lower and middle class having sustained good velocity of money due to poor wage increases higher than average housing and tuition increases and a lack of discretionary spending on top of upper income and corporation focused tax relief Would removing student debt accomplish increasing the velocity of money in that sector yes I would be interested to hear what your ideas for a more wide reaching and cost effective stimulus might look like Nobody has all of the answers as economies and markets are as we ve seen unpredictable But the foundational theory of the debt relief model is solid and it could set a catalyst for fixing the desperately broken college system in this country Part of what I do for work is study the forecasting models for large macroeconomic market conditions using big data at a major university The only time the projections fail is if all m recipients of relief save their cash flow for the rest of their life and never make a large economic purchase house land business or if they collectively all put it into the casino that is the stock market every month instead of using it to buy things now or save for large expenses That just isn t a very realistic possibility

850,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I always thought the problem was with the government getting involved with giving away student loans The loan system reform was introduced as an alternative to the prior status quo full public funding of public education Tuition was nominal consistent around a semester in todays dollars By shifting the costs to students and providing them guaranteed credit the government was able to save some money in the short term It was loaning money for a return instead of just spending it But in the long term there was a major change in who had the market power It used to be easy for the government to dictate terms to the universities as a monopolistic buyer but in the market model schools operate as oligopolistic competition The most visible change was in campus amenities Fully publicly funded schools were pretty spartan Dorms were tiny and there werent many facilities beyond the classroom or lab The government wasnt willing to pay for luxury dorms and new stadiums so they were exceedingly rare The government had all the market power as a monopolistic buyer and it had all the incentive to keep prices low year olds have little to no market power in the current situation If they refuse to buy the product their lifetime earnings will be reduced Price transparency is nonexistent because FAFSA student loan rates institutional aid scholarships tuition book costs and room board change annually They write the checks but they have no power individually to change the product
851,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,You have it backwards BUYING power has been spread to many reducing the ability of the buyer to dictate prices If the government was the only entity dealing with colleges they have the ability to massively negotiate the price of whatever they are buying because where else is the seller going to go to sell their product It is essentially the same argument for Medicare for all

858,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Of course they arent trying to be an accountant or doctor The role dictates the educational requirements Why does a laborer need a year degree
859,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The limit really bothers me because there are so many variables as to why students would never reach that too percentage and many of those variables are outside the students control Sometimes even the grading process itself is flawed by classist teachers and personal preferences relationships of educators and staff The same problem occurs in the Running Start program Smaller rural schools have built in classism in the participation numbers CC are typically miles away in another town so poverty excludes even high scoring students
860,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,That still limits the ability for many low income students to get the education they need to make a living Students from a higher income family tend to do better in school A lower income student in a higher income area could have a GPA and still not be in the top A student in a low income area with a GPA below could be in the top And on principle I don t think we shouldn t be pitting students against one another for access to an affordable education
861,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I don t like the idea of covering more costly state university four year degrees but I would suggest this All federal student loan debt goes to zero interest retroactively We would spend money on interest to pay for not charging interest but it would be worth it And we should cover two years of community college for all US citizens who want to go
862,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,And there are states who hand grants out to community colleges like candy

866,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,There is certainly admin creep but I d argue that is in part because we ve expanded what we expect from colleges which used to tailor their services to a narrower group of people rightly or wrongly
867,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Having lower enrolment rates but higher graduation rates seems like a win to me to those other countries as they end up not wasting money on educating those who should not be there in the first place While this is accurate realise that it means that asians will be heavily overrepresented and blacks will be heavily underrepresented and will cause significant political friction Racial quotas for college admissions have also been ruled unconstitutional in the US way back in early s so this reinforces the People who have money are able to give their children greater opportunities education while people without money get less

872,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Sure some states probably fund their public universities better than others but the phenomenon of state governments gradually reducing funding for public universities has been well documented across the country As far as budgetary responsibility goes a lot of that money has gone into incarceration and prisons and I think that money would be better spent educating the population than locking it up

874,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,you shouldnt and it was very much not intended to be that way its just were afraid of taxes on the middle class President Roosevelt met with Congress in to setup a national Toll Road system for the National interstate The Federal Aid Highway Act of directed the Bureau of Public Roads BPR the predecessor of the Federal Highway Administration to study the feasibility of a toll financed system of three east west and three north south superhighways The study entitled Toll Roads and Free Roads rejected the idea of a toll network but proposed a system of toll free interregional highways with connections to and around cities The network of highways would meet the needs of increasing automobile traffic and the requirements of national defense in time of war However for all their visionary skills they are sometimes criticized for their opposition to toll roads For example Phil Patton in Open Road A Celebration of the American Highway Simon and Schuster described how Toll Roads and Free Roads rejected the toll option based on traffic figures showing low demand in most corridors and predicted that the Philadelphia to Pittsburgh corridor would carry only cars a day The BPR had no notion that the construction of new superhighways like the introduction of such inventions as the telephone and the auto itself might create its own demand Similarly Dan Cupper in The Pennsylvania Turnpike A History Applied Arts Publishers Second Revised Edition pointed out that ridership after the turnpike opened on October completely defied the pessimistic predictions vehicles a day of the U S Bureau of Public Roads By the need for a Interstate was a pressing topic Although the President favored a self financing toll network the committee proposed creation of a Federal Highway Corporation The Federal Aid Highway Act was a large compromise in funding due to doubts still on traffic With creating The Highway Trust Fund as a dedicated revenue source for the Interstate System where Revenue from the Federal gas and other motor vehicle user taxes was credited to the Highway Trust Fund to pay the Federal share of Interstate construction and all other Federal aid highway projects In this way the Act guaranteed construction of all segments on a pay as you go basis thus satisfying one of President Eisenhowers primary requirements that the program be self financing and not contribute to budget deficits The U S combined gas tax rate per gallon State Federal is According to the OECD the second lowest Mexico is lower as the only country without a gas tax The road use tax on petrol is per litre in Norway and the CO tax on petrol is per litre The average gas tax rate among the advanced economies is per gallon In fact the U S s gas tax a rate less than half of that of the next highest country Canada which has a rate of per gallon Every time you buy gasoline you pay tax on tax The GST HST is charged on top of the per litre taxes That means you pay sales tax on the per litre taxes the government adds to the cost of the actual fuel That tax on tax costs the average Canadian driver an extra litre The Canadian governments will collect billion in taxes on the gasoline and diesel taxes in Add in that people pay less in gas tax due to mpg improvements In a f wd would pay gas tax of in Dollars per miles driven now a f pays in Dollars F has been the highest selling vehicle for years representing this year in cars sold The National Gas Tax has not been raised since when President Bill Clinton was in office and increased it Cents

894,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,lol nice caveats They completely destroy your own argument Not even remotely if that were true you would actually poke holes instead of just saying theres holes You forgot to mention that is low and most people dont save for college with investment accounts because they work up to that median income over time And You do realize that median means the middle as in half of all households make less and half make more and were talking households not individuals The median individual income is actually lower year

897,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,UBI would be pretty nice That helps with my student debt problem chronic health condition and might even allow me to move somewhere with more opportunities Maybe I could even buy a house in my s It probably wont happen though nor will this student loan forgiveness

899,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Republican politicians seem to be much more in touch and reactive to what their constituents really care about Im not sure where you got this idea Please elaborate which seems to have a lot of electoral power The electoral power comes from the gerrymandering the senate voter suppression etc For example the Democratic half of the Senate represents over more people than the Republican half Even the Dem minority before the last election represented million more The party that got supreme court justices lost the popular vote and had those justices confirmed by senators representing a minority of Americans The vote to convict the president yesterday represented like million more Americans than the vote to acquit Thats where the power seems to come from the senate and the filibuster
900,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Then I assume you voted against the disaster that is Trump and you lean right and were never really in play for democrats in a normal election anyway What a ridiculous hill to die on politically especially for someone willing to vote libertarian Canceling reducing publicly held debt should be near the top of any libertarians list of good things
901,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,This is not quite correct the government pays out the loan money to the universities and then partners with corporations like Navient who with some unsaid level of nuance basically purchase the debts If the US forgives debts they will make payouts to the loan servicers
902,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Thats only a semantic point It doesnt cost them less to do so that money is still calculated in the coffers as assets Its no different to the government to cancel that debt than it is to pay off a different kind of debt
903,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,They own Powell who owns the printer
904,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,But we could say this about any welfare program too In fact because of the nature of who owes student debt and who needs welfare the economic multiplier effects for welfare recipients are likely far higher because of their marginal propensity to consumer The effect of student loan forgiveness would also be softened by existing loan forgiveness and income based repayment plans which would make it a less attractive option if our end goal would simply be on economic grounds

909,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I think one of us is misunderstanding the other Regardless of how long the person goes to college the years forgiveness doesnt apply until graduation So of I go to Community College it applies as soon as I graduate But if I go for a bachelors or higher years once I graduate then the first years of my debt are forgiven Using this approach I still have to take on the debt initially It acts as a motivator to complete courses successfully since if I fail drop out etc I am now saddled with that debt as punishment Limiting the forgiveness to years completed instead of fixed dollar amount also pushes me to be a full time student to get classes done quicker Although the more I think about it Im not totally sure I like that part Im just not sure how to word it otherwise without making it more complicated ATM Studies have shown that any post secondary education completion increases lifetime earnings Higher degrees tend to also have higher increases Additionally most commercial trades plumber electrician etc require a person go to a trade school before they can be fully licensed or allowed to join their respective unions As a closer the US infrastructure system roads bridges water supply waste lines the entire electrical grid cough California cough is horribly out of date in desperate need of repair Making schooling for such trades cheaper would go a long way to building the workforce needed to fix it all

916,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I m more approaching this issue as a way to get past the economic problems caused by COVID There are certainly longer run benefits to forgiveness just like paying off most people s various debt obligations would have positive longer term economic effects for those receiving it and ancillary benefits for those in the economy who do not However the timing of the economic impact of SL forgiveness is not immediate enough to justify the price tag when other stimulus plans directly benefit those in the most need much quicker
917,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Free at point of use means that its paid for with public funding i e taxes before an individual uses it and is not charged when doing so Generally also is in reference to a policy being universally available as opposed to means tested Public school is already treated this way but only for K

926,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Id just caution that years are a bit of a fuzzy metric to use in post secondary because people can take variable course loads Might be simpler to just say first k of your loan is converted to a grant with or without conditions attached like graduating and after that the rest is interest free It also wouldnt be too hard to apply it retroactively hence the k payouts conversation were having today

938,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,In a perfect world high school would get the gen Ed classes out of the way My program engineering was relatively light on gen ed requirements and even then it was almost two semesters worth of classes If you improve K to the point where gen ed is obsolete suddenly a year bachelors degree is feasible

945,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,The government already subsidizes specific programs with handouts that are effectively free furthermore Banks already benefit from free handouts in the form of being able to get money straight from the Federal reserve The Federal reserve handouts arent exactly free but the interest rates are so low that they might as well be Companies also got a free handout during the economic recession the government got its money back from there solely because the companies created value and recovered from the crash the process to getting repayment is the same thing that existing debt collectors use when debtors are in arrears wage garnishment and liens
946,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,That s what it s going to be but the thing is don t we already accept that for the taxes we pay Why not also for student loans especially as a compromise position of removing interest It would help borrowers to not have their debt inflate and the enforcement isn t the point it s just the incentive to continue to pay it off rather than the interest
947,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,I would agree that is doesnt guarantee it a PhD on Norse mythology doesnt help but in general the good of allowing lower to middle class families that cant pay for a decent engineering degree outweighs the bad There was a study a few years back that showed lower to middle class families ones that are more in need of financial assistance chose more professional jobs doctor engineer etc while those from upper middle upper class families chose the less productive more artistic jobs

958,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,You didnt get my point at all but thats fine Whether or not this is a good policy The vast majority of those who would benefit still spend the money and it would go back into the economy unlike the tax cuts you tried to compare them to

960,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Thank you for the clarification and explanation Its hard for me to see value in debt forgiveness of two years of a four year degree I agree that higher education will generally get you more earnings over the course of a lifetime however if you are an engineer you will automatically start at a higher salary than say an english major yet both get debt forgiveness Where I see the opportunity is the two year community colleges and the trade schools where appreciable skills can be gained while not taking on the debt burden of a larger institution
961,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Bullshit Student loan debt isnt just tuition and books Its also room and board and if youre an adult learner or otherwise need to support yourself that means your student loans cover rent while you take time off work or reduce your hours to go to school

975,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,Might be simpler to just say first k of your loan is converted to a grant The problem of giving out money like that in a grant loan is that it seems the cost of education will rise to meet students having that money available Any amount of continued government payout for education needs to be accompanied by cost regulations to ensure students arent being overcharged The whole education cost balloon is a result of government money being available with little oversight

1016,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,That makes sense and I can see where youre coming from I was fortunate to get an engineering degree a decade ago that I use daily and I was able to pay off my loans Nowadays many of my friends have jobs where they are dutifully paying to their student loans but years in their principal has barely budged I get why people want the loan forgiveness k k but that doesnt solve the problem but introduces many more Since you cant solve the entire problem at one time a very low interest rate on loans and maybe extend the payment period would help people have more money in their pocket to buy a small house and get themselves some stability so they can actually pay back the loan without needing a bailout All this backfires of course if jobs arent available or people spend more than they have or are unlucky and have a major hospital bill But it feels like a start in the right direction and about as center of a position as I can find

1026,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,State colleges need to attract students Private colleges are building more amenities to attract students make the claim to justify their expense State colleges do the same The entire market of tuition room board prices rise due to the fact that state colleges wish to compete in the same market to attract the money that they need Its not a waste of money to state colleges because that is what they need to do to market to the direct beneficiaries of their product This is a separate argument to the benefits of the government being the monopolistic buyer of the product instead of the case now where they are merely loan officers giving money to the many buyers and schools being oligopolistic sellers If the government is the only purchaser of college education on the behalf of a student applicant they can negotiate the prices of various elements for the class as a whole across multiple universities and colleges This has the effect of bringing down the price on education

1047,Reddit,Not known,reddit comment,My personal opinion is to not guarantee loans at all However in my opinion it is a problem in our current society that we should address somehow You make a good point that zero interest would make the loans not economically feasible so maybe just lowering the interest significantly would be better An alternative proposal then for me would be to extend the grace period post graduation months is hardly long at all to get a decent job and start saving some money and being able to make good financial investments before you have to make the payments on your loans
