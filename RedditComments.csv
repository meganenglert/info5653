Reddit,gn46mmm,We need to fix the system that created the problem before putting a tiny band aid on it US colleges were perfectly fine institutions in the s and s and happened to be pretty affordable The quality of education has not improved but the costs to students has skyrocketed,t3_lij7jt,1184

Reddit,gn4ob13,My vote is to at least do away with the high interest It should be zero or only get hit with fees if someone misses payments I ve paid over the past years on my k loan income based repayment plan as an architect none of that has touched the principle and the loan is now k,t3_lij7jt,313

Reddit,gn6aly9,Makes no sense why only a pariculalr subset of pepople should benefit If they were giving out free cash to the tune of one billion it would be more fsir to simply divide it equally amongst the population,t3_lij7jt,12
Reddit,gn4mqnu,No it treats a symptom and not the cause Students really dont have a choice when it comes to getting the most for their money as a typical undergrad will have to go thru years of basic classes that either do not pertain to their major and or are things they already had in HS Textbooks were an absolute racket when I was in school Now with everything digital you dont own the material but a license to use it for a specified period of time All to the tune of or so Student loan amounts can increase by k and tuition will follow soon after I highly doubt anyone in the exec or legislative branch have the balls to address the problem high tuition waste by schools So while the books can be erased for those holding student loan debt well be right back to this pickle within years,t3_lij7jt,73
Reddit,gn4o46y,I m a bigger fan on just eliminating the interest to simply cover cost of your loan processing Lower all rates to or whatever Cap tuition rate increases for state universities Make enrolling in loan forgiveness easier Those are better solutions AND THEY DONT COST A PENNY I m not in favor of k write offs It benefits people who signed up for the debt will make significantly more than a non degree worker and doesn t solve the issue of exploding college costs,t3_lij7jt,96

Reddit,gn4qq7m,All I want is interest free debt Ill take debt forgiveness but I wouldnt call that a good idea Its like rent control useful in the short term but the politicians who propose it dont have long term solutions and will just get reelected off their short term success,t3_lij7jt,18
Reddit,gn4eeju,Let me first say that my wife and I would benefit greatly from k of student loan forgiveness However I feel that forgiving this much student loan debt will be politically risky for the Democrats This move will alienate the non college educated voters for several elections Now this may be a risk that the Dems should take as this subsection of the electorate is shrinking and the move will make the college educated millennial voters who make up a substantial portion of the Dem base,t3_lij7jt,52
Reddit,gn4t66o,The problem is that colleges know they can keep inflating their prices and it will always be backed by loans that will be given to anyone willing to take them on I think complete forgiveness is terrible However perhaps lowering the interest rate to minimal amounts At least pay back the principal To think you can just take a loan and then not pay it back is a dangerous path in my opinion,t3_lij7jt,9
Reddit,gn426d0,As someone with student loans Im not gonna say no to forgiveness Its in my self interest Whether its in the national interest or not I dont know,t3_lij7jt,131
Reddit,gn8jmjd,My impression is that Americans want to have the full college experience and want to live in a residence across the country instead of staying at home but also expect it to be very cheap Can someone enlighten me on what s the cost of a local unsexy university With no rent or anything assuming living with parents,t3_lij7jt,7
Reddit,gn4hwks,Cancelling student loan debt is an objectively regressive policy People with degrees on average make far more than people without degrees Its subsidizing the segment of the population that statistically is the most well off by taking money out of the pockets of those who are not Imagine free healthcare but only for those have a college degree Imagine a minimum wage but only for those who have a college degree Thats literally what this is Further it does nothing to solve the problem and arguably will make it worse Much like with healthcare the issue isnt who pays for it The issue the high costs in the first place College tuition does not need to be as high as it is but schools just keep spending more and more on pointless bullshit Elizabeth Warren for example made over a little while back at Harvard She taught one class over a two year span This is already on top of her substantial salary as a Senator Is that much really necessary I really dont think so Look at someone more reasonable like Justice Kavanaugh In when he was lecturing at Harvard his salary was in addition to his salary as a federal judge That makes a lot more sense Why cant everything be like that Unless theres a plan to cancel student loan debt every several years or so well be right back here in a few years Students will keep taking out more and more loans because in the back of their heads theyll think the government will just let them off the hook again And because the government showed that theyre willing to do this schools will just make tuition whatever they want because it will get paid off no matter what Imagine someone taking out thousands of dollars in loans for school and then saving up an equal amount for a house and a car Imagine another person taking out thousands of dollars in loans for a house and a car and saving up an equal amount for school In this scenario only one would have their debt cancelled Or what if someone chose to not go to college because they knew they wouldnt be able to pay off loans Are they going to get punished because they chose to do something responsible while people who fucked up get off scot free That is absolutely insane and any politician who advocates for forgiving student loan debt should be deservedly ridiculed,t3_lij7jt,26
Reddit,gn4w75u,I fully support a UBI and I fucking hate the idea of student loan forgiveness That middle class parent who scrimped and saved every penny going into a fund to fully pay for their child to go to school finally seeing it pay off when their child finished their degree last year NOT GETTING A CENT OF STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS The recent graduate who gave up on their dreams of being a teacher because it just didnt pay well instead opting to use their student loan money to push them into a higher paying career where they were able to pay off their loans in years of employment instead of the years a teacher will take while using current loan forgiveness programs NOT GETTING A CENT OF STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS The blue collar worker who could have succeeded in college but instead decided that going into tens of thousands of dollars in debt was too risky for them so theyre just making ends meet as best they can without a degree NOT GETTING A CENT OF STUDENT LOAN FORGIVENESS The well off kid who got a federal student loan so they could keep their trust fund sitting in TSLA stock for the past years slacking off getting a basic business degree before they get a guaranteed job from their family friend WILL BE GETTING A TON OF LOAN FORGIVENESS under these plans,t3_lij7jt,37
Reddit,gn4om8c,No this picks societal winners and losers presents a moral hazard for university admins and doesn t do anything to actually make a college education more affordable It s a short term political win not a long term solution,t3_lij7jt,22
Reddit,gn4xzlk,No that money should go to peoples whose jobs were lost because of the pandemic Not college grads working from home collecting the same paychecks On top of that if this was republicans offering this up it would be classified as systemic racism as minorities would be getting a much smaller piece of the pie,t3_lij7jt,19
Reddit,gn9uo6c,It depends what is the goal Is the goal is to eliminate the voluntary debt of mostly upper middle class white women Then yes it is a good idea If your goal is to lower costs of college which is what it should be If your goal is to get more poorer people into college which is what it should be If you goal is to funnel people into majors with the highest earning potentials and away from low earning majors and they can get jobs were they can pay off their debt which is what it should be Then the answer is no it is a horrible idea,t3_lij7jt,6
Reddit,gnahire,What ever happened to self responsibility If you are going to be dumb you better be tough Why do we need to continuously coddle everyone This country was not built or has progressed on weakness Parents politicians and everyone now a days are worried about how they will be perceived if they make the correct tough decisions,t3_lij7jt,4

Reddit,gn7pliz,My complaint would be that poor ppl dont have student loans bc poor ppl dont even consider college to be an option obviously generalizing Why not do something significant like this that affects everyone under a certain income level,t3_lij7jt,4
Reddit,gn9chr0,No I dont think it is a good idea This is would a transfer of wealth from the of Americans without a degree to those with a with a degree Even more so when you consider that the majority of student debt is held by people with post graduate degrees who make up only of Americans These are precisely the cohort that have benefited the most from the economy in the past few decade while most of those without degrees have either stayed put or have fallen behind It is simply unjust to give a boost to societys designated winners at the expense of the losers the main problem with student loans is that they allowed for the expense of education to inflated rapidly without any effort to keep cost under control Forgiving student does nothing to bring the schools under control and will likely see costs inflate even further since Uncle Sam will eventually forgive most of that debt anyway Thus loan forgiveness will exacerbate number even further It is simply a moral hazard and should be avoided,t3_lij7jt,4
Reddit,gna7ffr,I ve been thinking we should prioritize community colleges There are a lot of adults who want to better themselves and make up for lost time due to mistakes in adolescence but they are at a loss as to what to do Providing free community college may rectify that problem,t3_lij7jt,5
Reddit,gnbevey,Counter question is over paying for a liberal arts degree a good idea In my mind it isnt not many people make it after getting theirs I wouldnt get one and definitely dont want to pay for someone elses mistake They should do what myself and many of my friends did and work through school or start with an associates or trade then find a company that will pay for school Edit I would like to add that I do love the idea of free education But with the approach like the military provides service for your education However for those that are not able to join the military or dont want to I think another term of service should be an option like working for a group like habitat for humanity or something that provides a community benefit,t3_lij7jt,4
Reddit,gnbydwd,Given that the majority of the country did not attend college let alone take on debt do you think this is going to be a popular way to spend money This is a lot of money to spend on a minority of the population especially when the system that created it still exists,t3_lij7jt,4
Reddit,gn4hvc4,No This does nothing to fix the issue that created the problem In years we will be in the same position again The reason college is so expensive is because it is so easy to get tens of thousands of dollars to pay for it This is because the government backs the loans and the loans cannot be cleared through bankruptcy It is essentially free money for the lenders because there is no risk to them This influx of money combined with the notion that you have to attend college to be successful laughably wrong btw drove demand for college through the roof When demand goes up so do prices Colleges came up with all sorts of new degree programs to absorb the large number of less qualified students applying and then for profit schools sprang up to take the unqualified The bottom line is government backed loans created this problem If the bill doesn t do away with government backed loans that cannot be cleared through bankruptcy then it is nothing more than a vote buying scheme The real solution is to get the government out of the student aid business altogether Within a few years tuition will drop and no more young people will be saddled with a debt they can never hope to repay because banks will stop lending money to everyone with a pulse I would say a combination of paying everyone who currently has or had in the past a student loan up to and ending government backed or funded student loans makes the most sense Obviously the k would go toward any outstanding loan balance first then the rest would go to the individual if they had k or more in debt originally but paid it down or off,t3_lij7jt,21
Reddit,gn3fbxm,I personally think it s a bad idea First you re giving money to people who largely make more money than those who don t have college debt it s regressive The median new college grad starting out makes nearly year more than the median of all only HS grad Second it s a ton of money That s about months worth of Social security Or months at the median US wage of k So wealthier than average people really be getting that big a handout Third it s a terrible stimulus It s beubg sold as one but clearing someone s balance sheet has a fractional impact on increasing cash flow Thus for the amount of money being spend it is a bad stimulus Fourth Student Debt isn t even particularly large T sounds like a lot but Americans also have T in Auto debt and about the same in Credit Card debt And those latter two are actually distributed so the poor have more Fifth College Debt holders have already gotten more than non debt holders They ve gotten or so in deferred interest if they have in debt That s about the sum of the stimulus checks if the is approved Sixth that demographic of College Educated people are less likely to have lost their jobs than those who don t have one So you d be giving money to people less likely to have been impacted by the Corona recession Generally I think you re giving money to people who want it Not need it And especially in the hardship experienced by many it s a very bad tone to throw that money around to people who don t need it,t3_lij7jt,56
Reddit,gn56mic,Here is my issue and I don t know how this will be received To me student loan forgiveness is essentially a welfare handout to people above average in income I agree with the idea of welfare for people who lose their jobs and need to buy essentials College increases someone s human capital Point blank you are worth more if you go to college I am on mobile so can t link to the sources but they exist a google away I went to college and I chose my college with cost in mind I come from a single parent household where my mom was a teacher so by no means rich I am and I could pay off my student loans right now Free college exists they are given in scholarships If we want to talk about free college I could be convinced If we wanted to buy all the student loans and not collect interest I could be convinced If we wanted to create scholarships so it was free to most or significantly cheaper for all I could be convinced But providing a handout to people who make above average income doesn t make sense to me especially in the context of them voluntarily taking on the debt in exchange for a increase in their human capital which they get to keep,t3_lij7jt,8
Reddit,gn4v1zt,I used govt loans to get my Ph D In I owed with low interest rates and extended payments It was a no brainer Then the Reagan Republicans privatized student loans i e turned them over to capitalist bankers to set the vulture interest rates and the repayment rules While sucking away federal support for universities driving up tuition costs The bankers have successfully lobbied against any relaxation in student loan interest rates even while other loan rates have collapsed in recent years This is a mismanaged situation of epic proportions https www merriam webster com dictionary clusterfuck Calling a relaxation on student debt obligations costs nothing to taxpayers or to the federal government thanks to the privatization that they already accomplished,t3_lij7jt,11

Reddit,gn4urd6,A year education now is like a high school education decades ago We should socialize it like we did HS primary school before it Neither of my grandfathers made it to HS and they both had careers that provided salaries they could raise kid families on and own property in high COL areas They knew job security and could afford hobbies dreams They would be this year I lost the last one in September after months of watching him fade His fear for his widows well being shes not a natural citizen has always made her living via her own small business is well past retirement age herself without his pension broke my fkn heart What were used to isnt long history normal,t3_lij7jt,3

Reddit,gn6461v,I have worked in Higher Ed for some time There are two main issues that lead to student debt are colleges and the government Inefficient colleges coupled with increased loan availability from the govt leads to students making bad decisions and falling into more debt The colleges themselves Most are massive land holding entities that spend more money on developing land around their campus building amenities at the university rather than investing in staff curriculum development etc Most Schools are trying to sell you an experience rather than an education They will improve dorms gyms stadiums build e sports arenas but have dilapidated classrooms without functioning HVAC systems Inefficiencies Colleges make money on a few programs and lose money on the majority of their programs Colleges will keep programs with low enrollment at a loss because a Professor or Director has clout with the hierarchy Made up programs A lot of colleges do not consult industry as much as they should when developing curriculum instead because of the point above colleges start making programs to fill existing seats You take a few classes from one program a few classes for another and voila you have a completely new degree Now you will only get people so what do you have to do create another made up degree Schools will sell these as highly customizable degrees but basically its all their unwanted leftovers Lack of foresight Colleges will make huge risky investments that take years to develop rather than having a rainy day fund If you are wondering why schools with billion dollar endowments qualified for COVID relief Well that endowment is not liquid Most of it is land holding So the university can sink million into a luxury commercial building that will have no university use however this is an upfront cost that will take years to see revenue So when something like COVID hits and you have two or three of those projects you are SOL Budgeting in general Again going off of my previous inefficiency theme You would be shocked at the amount of gambles Universities make For starters most schools rely on tuition grants donations to function The biggest cash cow is generally the undergrad class If a school gets undergrad student this year they budget next year expecting rather than playing it safe They shell out money for development like that is years away Then al l of the sudden someone gets shot raped on campus and it makes the national news Next years undergrad class ends up having students as a result All of the sudden you are short million in your budget because students arnt paying for tuition rom and board What do you do cut pay increase lay off staff you sure as shit cant take the money back from your development projects Ultimately people leave and the student experience suffers Government FAFSA Loan Limits continue to move up this allows colleges to continue raising the cost of attendance without having repercussions A typical masters degree costs k in the US and most people complete them in about two years Why because the aggregate limit per year for standard grad loans is The aggregate limit for total Stafford graduate loans is about K Since you cannot take out more than in Stafford govt undergrad loans So essentially every person who gets into a Masters program can pay for it fully only using loans If this limit goes up the average tuition rate will move right with it Even though this is not the govts goal it is essentially exacerbating the cost of attendance by allowing massive amounts of student loans to be taken out There is very little that the govt is doing to keep schools accountable infact by increasing loan limits each year they are doing the opposite They are continuously rewarding bad behavior with more funding If there were a way to limit the amount of loans the cost of tuition would inevitably have to go down though this would take time,t3_lij7jt,3

Reddit,gn42xz2,Yeah I paid off my loans already but Im totally for this Those loans are crippling to so many people IMO it stiffles innovation by forcing people to take soul sucking corporate gigs instead of going off to innovate and find ways to make a big impact on society Think of it as an investment in the economy The real solution should be to make college more affordable though so people dont have to take out crippling loans to go to school,t3_lij7jt,26
Reddit,gn4fyhx,I am against this idea because I have made sacrifices in order to not have student loan debt,t3_lij7jt,26
Reddit,gn4q1m4,No It s not a good idea Besides the obvious unfairness of it it has many unintended consequences Recent grads who now have less debt to pay can accept lower salaries and they ll begin bidding down wages which just adds even more injury to people who already paid off their loans It will only lead to more reckless and irresponsible borrowing If you want people to stop accruing massive student debt stop guaranteeing massive student loans It really is that simple Colleges will be forced to lower prices,t3_lij7jt,11
Reddit,gn4oaz0,No its a very stupid idea It is a wealth transfer to people who will already on the whole end up wealthier than the average American since college grads still have much higher lifetime net earnings than non college grads Furthermore it only helps those who currently hold debt Not those who have paid their debt off not those who have yet to take on debt not those who chose cheaper colleges to take on less debt not those worked through out college to pay for their education not those who joined the military to have their college payed for No one forced people to take on huge amounts of student debt they made that decision for themselves That doesnt mean there shouldnt be some type of relief for people who were deceived or are truly being crushed right now but there is no reason it has to be complete forgiveness and it should not be at the expense of other people who made different decisions Now cancelling the interest on government loans some type of universal public service loan forgiveness relief for people who were duped by unscrupulous for profit institutions these are reasonable ideas that we could have a conversation about Blanket student debt forgiveness is one of the dumber and least equitable ideas that the left seem to be in love with recently It is baffling to me,t3_lij7jt,9

Reddit,gn4up1q,At the very least interest should be forgiven Education shouldn t be a business the profit motive of public education is why degrees are now both devalued and more expensive I also think public service forgiveness should be pro rated monthly rather than only after years of service with easily made paperwork error disqualifiers I worked years in a public service job at a significantly lower than private sector salary while paying an IBR monthly payment that didn t cover interest Life changed my ability to hold the public service job and now I owe more than I borrowed,t3_lij7jt,2
Reddit,gn4xxpz,It doesnt matter anymore if its a good idea or not could be or even in loan forgiveness Only way the Fed can keep this ship afloat is to print print print Based on foundational economic principles IMO not a good idea long term but we are well passed standards and principles and have been in uncharted territory for a long time now In the economy of I think it has to happen,t3_lij7jt,2

Reddit,gn80wai,Degrees are investments Just because you did not make a good investment by getting a niche degree that doesnt pay out or you didnt finish your degree doesnt mean others should be responsible for paying back for your mistake This would be like bailing out wallstreet investors because they made a bad investment So no I do not think its a good idea The money will have to come from somewhere to which would be the taxpayer and not all taxpayers went to school In fact most taxpayers did not go to college A better alternative is to drop the federal loan program A lot of the reason why school has become so expensive is because so much money has become available since just about anyone can take out a loan due to them being federally secured The school ends up getting its money and the lender and borrower are on the hook Schools have become giant scams offering so many niche degrees that really have no real value in the real world and so many people are getting hooked with them The reality is most of us have no need to go to higher education Learning a trade or going straight into the workforce is the better alternative Im on the type that unless someone else is willing to pay for your degree as in you got rich parents or you earn a full scholarship youre better off not going to college,t3_lij7jt,2

Reddit,gn8tch9,It s a good idea if it s done alongside a serious plan to reduce costs Simply erasing debt does nothing to fix long term cost increases A lot of posts have mentioned administrative costs etc as a main driver of cost increases and I agree but I think one change that also needs to be made is student expectations of what college is I went to college in Europe for a year and the facilities were very bare bones American students have an expectation of what colleges should be fancy student center new sports facilities fancy dorms and that is a big driver of costs too Too much focus is on the college experience rather than the pursuit of an education,t3_lij7jt,2

Reddit,gna80xz,Depends on the context of the question Certainly it makes far more sense than the tax cuts a few years back did but I think you would anger many blue collar voters who never went to college as well as some people who already paid off their loans Personally I think it should be means tested so the people benefitting from what would be a massive government handout are people who actually need it not just want it and perhaps it should be closer to an interest rate reduction thats retroactive so its not strictly a handout But Im fine with whatever they go through with on a personal level I may have paid my loans off already but Im also not the sort of person who thinks I suffered so you should too,t3_lij7jt,2

Reddit,gn7qtjn,Exactly If we forgive the debt the problem is going to come back in a few years time so instead we probably need at minimize the amount of interest that goes onto student loans especially if the answer isnt going to be something along the lines of a free college program which for whatever reason will be difficult to get through Congress but possible on the State level in some places So I would start by recommending a student loan interest cap on all federal student loans The idea is you have a number that is some percentage of the actual student loan you get lets say to keep it easy and when you accrue a lifetime interest of of that loan no more interest is accrued and then you pay back the loan as normal without having to worry about gathering any additional interest With this you are able to keep most of the existing infrastructure in place and because there would be a cap in place to keep student debt from going completely out of control income based repayment becomes a real and viable option for actually paying off student loans There is probably going to be a need to cap the interest on existing federal loans that are way past any cap percentage that anyone would recommend that way there would at least be an end in sight for a lot of these borrowers Obviously I think this would need to be done alongside other major changes like addressing textbooks for profit colleges free tuition alongside other wider reaching changes like increases to minimum wage This is just a suggestion I have been thinking about because I know I personally have done well under the current system but I have done so while certain individuals have suffered greatly from absolutely crippling debt This is just a way to fix the system and not getting rid of all of the jobs and positions that currently exist now because of the system and can serve as a stepping stone to eventually phase the system out entirely when its possible,t1_gn46mmm,1

Reddit,gn8svec,All of these problems can be boiled down to one phenomenon the rise of the administrator Universities are exponentially more expensive now because universities became businesses somewhere down the line and businesses need administrators But universities are not meant to be businesses and indeed the business model runs contrary to at least one of the university s missions which is the impartial awarding of grades on the basis of merit That s hard enough to achieve in a merit centric model but when your students are literally paying customers it becomes disincentivized outright So they hire more and more admins to fill ever multiplying marketing niches essentially It s no wonder most of our universities have become sports teams with schools attached having a good team is great marketing So another utterly predictable side effect of this is that profs are encouraged to go easy on college athletes Did they do C work Then maybe we should consider awarding them a B or change a b to a B ad infinitum And the predictable side effect of that is that grades increasingly fail to reflect the quality of one s actual work This way of organizing education is counterproductive and as we can all plainly see unsustainable So we can reform higher education now by ripping the bandaid off and mandating the removal of all nonessential administrators a solution that would do immense short term harm to those whose livelihoods are found in university administration or wait for the system to collapse under the weight of its own overhead The problem with waiting is that in the meantime costs will continue to rise and graduation will become more and more dependent on income This will obviously exacerbate income inequality even more as hard as that might be to imagine,t1_gn46mmm,1
Reddit,gn92u5s,Yes exactly The reason for the increase in costs is due to government backed student loans coupled with bloated administrative costs These types of loans allowed colleges to charge increasingly more money with the knowledge that students will pay because the government will be backing these loans Students take on high levels of debt and there is no incentive to decrease tuition because the demand is still high for the those loans,t1_gn46mmm,1

Reddit,gn83019,Ive tried to make that point but that poster hit it spot on They said it in a much more convincing way Essentially to forgive student loan debt for every debtor would be a grossly inequitable policy Just as that post points out there are many who did not assume the burden of debt who will be shafted Whats worse many of the debtors who suddenly are relieved of their debt burden get a substantial leg up in wealth building over so many others who either never took on debt or who already paid it off I wont go through the example Ive used before but in basic terms over time the elimination of say monthly loan payment will go a long way for young recent graduates to leap older more temporally distant graduates in wealth building Likewise a college graduates income ceiling is generally much greater than a non college graduate In other words not only will the college graduate earn more money in their lifetime but the short term financial sacrifice necessary to achieve that would be eliminated The long term effects of such an inequitable policy are almost never discussed and maybe not seriously considered There are other ways to help people who are truly struggling with no light at the end of the tunnel For one as many others have commented reduce interest rates so the monthly payment applies to nearly all of the principal Another make it easier to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy and include legal safeguards to protect against debtors feigning poverty to get the benefit of bankruptcy There is no doubt that student loan debt is problem But simply discharging debt for every borrower is not an equitable solution,t1_gn564x0,39

Reddit,gnc4epa,going to cheap state schools instead of top tier ones Unfortunately even cheap state schools are outrageously expensive For me there was no cost difference between a state school and a private school because state schools are so expensive where I live Ive been attending a cheap online university while working full time lately because I actively chose to avoid student loans Im paying my own way upfront I wish I had this option Unfortunately college costs have gotten to the point where its basically impossible to make enough money to pay it up front loans are pretty much inevitable Minimum wage is where I live non minimum wage jobs dont pay much better In other words its not that A already suffered and got theirs while B is suffering Its that A got their reward no debt and B got theirs meaningful university experience and now B wants to get As reward too This is way too simple for this kind of situation We need to look at the material effect of massive student loan debt and astronomical college costs on the population Many people with degrees are severely underpaid but have more debt despite these low wages This leads to delays in starting their careers moving out on their own buying a house and even having children in the future if thats what they want Theres lots of people my age who want to have children but have come to the realization that they most likely wont be financially stable enough to have children I dont want children personally but Ive realized I will most likely never be able to buy a house I am far from alone Many people dont go to the doctor when something is wrong which of course often leads to worse health outcomes later down the line Theres speculation that millennials will be the first generation to not have a longer life expectancy than their parents generation Suicide rates are up amongst Gen Z I dont think it takes a genius to figure out just how bad all of this is for the economy and society overall And then throw a climate crisis on top of all this So this notion that people who went to college and took out loans to do so didnt have to make sacrifices or put their life on hold is bullshit It is a very poor understanding of the situation we are in as a society I graduated not even years ago and I already feel like my life is over Its not going to get better We need to do SOMETHING because things are about to get real bad Forgive or whatever amount Abolish the interest rates erase interest amounts from balances and apply interest payments already made towards the principal amount Automatically forgive after years no matter what Make it possible to declare bankruptcy on student loans private ones too if you cant declare bankruptcy on them Legislation to control college costs Free community college Free healthcare and more legislation for workers protections too while were at it And maybe some legislation addressing housing costs I dont want anyone else to suffer like this We cant just sit here and do nothing,t1_gn564x0,-1
Reddit,gn5dh7q,The problem is this Colleges charge as much as they think they can get away with charging because People are okay with paying that amount of money because College loans are so heavily subsidized that there s not enough actual cost because Colleges charge as much hm IMO what needs to happen is the government needs to stop giving students cheap loans and student loans need to stop being exempt from discharge under bankruptcy Private loans especially with the added risk of bankruptcy are more expensive so the real cost of college loans rises More people decide it s a raw deal and opt out of college for trade schools or entrepreneurship and such College demand drops and it s cost follows Also hopefully having fewer people with silly extraneous degrees running around will force employers to realize that they don t really mean that much and so demand for degrees will drop even further,t1_gn4mqnu,17
Reddit,gn4vtmg,Students really dont have a choice when it comes to getting the most for their money as a typical undergrad will have to go thru years of basic classes that either do not pertain to their major and or are things they already had in HS Sure they do Community college teaches all of those same classes for a small fraction of the price On top of that a lot of states have programs that allow community college grads to easily transfer to any public school in the same state to earn their BS BA We absolutely have a choice in the matter and there is a lower barrier of entry for that route than most state funded year schools,t1_gn4mqnu,8
Reddit,gn61cmw,I strongly disagree with the first two paragraphs my college nominally requires its students to spend approximately of the units that a typical student is expected to take on general education requirements but in practice it is easy to load many of these requirements into one s freshman year eg by taking or classes at once when the recommended course load is thereby freeing up space later to take useful courses In addition AP and IB credit and CC classes can be really helpful in escaping breadth requirements Secondly while textbooks have a high price pirating textbooks has never been easier For the flip side of digitization is that when everything is online it s much easier to get it for free Also textbooks are only a small fraction of the cost of school my public university costs K per year but only K is expected to be spent annually on textbooks I d imagine that for private universities the proportion is even smaller I definitely agree on the increases in loans being mostly absorbed by increases in tuition though,t1_gn4mqnu,3

Reddit,gn4454f,Agreed on all fronts The main argument against the unqualified debt forgiveness is regressive position that Ive seen is increase to student debt doesnt causatively increase earning which is disingenuous in that it subtly but very significantly changes the basis of the discussion No nobody reasonable is saying taking out more debt makes you earn more Its the people youd be giving the money to with blanket forgiveness averaged and aggregated across the population need the money a lot less than other groups I dont really see that as fundamentally contentious and it should be a showstopper all by itself An incremental needs based payment assistance or even better payment credit program would make a lot more sense Below a certain income threshold and can prove you make a regular payment of some amount Great heres a rebate for of it Make a little more OK heres and the difference better be less than the income difference to avoid perverse incentive Left college to an immediate six figure job Sorry youre not getting much not that you dont deserve it you just dont need it as much as other people do I also think we need to acknowledge that yes theres an unfairness aspect to it Stop pretending there isnt Thats not the point we want to minimize unnecessary unfairness but were also not optimizing for individual fairness of outcome which would require way more and way more subjective of data than we have were instead optimizing for an overall economic benefit across the whole population And even then when you make it needs based its still going to be true that the neediest of graduates are still going to be a lot less needy than of some other groups Whether or not thats a blocker is up for debate remember overall impact not individual fairness but it needs to be brought into the discussion Ive made a very comfortable income ever since and with internships even before my graduation Part of that is being strategic about my choice of curriculum and field but part of it is and always will be just good luck I wouldnt have been at all selfishly upset about being thrown extra money but thatd have been an absolutely idiotic thing from a holistic perspective I never had to struggle and the money wouldve in all likelihood just sunk straight into long term investment vehicles and done little to nothing for the economy,t1_gn3fbxm,11
Reddit,gn4o9z3,The biggest arguments for cancelling federal student debt in my opinion are both bc it would be good for the economy as a whole Free up debt service money to go into the rest of the economy kinda already happening since loans are on hold Every dollar spent on education returns more to the country and more tax revenue to the government than investing in almost anything else This https www bostonfed org media Documents cb PDF Trostel invest in higher ed pdf report is a little old but states the government gets back over in increased future tax revenue and decreased future government assistance for every dollar spent It makes economic sense to make all federal student aid into grants rather than loans as the government is already recouping its investment and then some no matter what it s among the cheapest forms of economic stimulus since it s just writing off debt that s on the books It doesn t actually cost the government much of anything in terms of cash out the door only lost future interest revenue I agree cancelling debt is a band aid for the larger issue of skyrocketing costs for higher education however it makes a lot of economic sense to do it,t1_gn3fbxm,8

Reddit,gn7k75m,Yeah that s pretty much the long and short of it We won t know what will happen until some sort of debt relief happens but the theory is yes the added cash flow monthly by the m borrowers that now have increased discretionary spending being recirculated through the economy would stimulate multiple market sectors most notably local consumer discretionary spending retail and grocery Which just so happens to be some of the hardest hit COVID sectors and have municipalities tax built in so win win If affording it is the issue we could fairly easily pay for this and net with ease by repealing the Trump tax cuts which have a net negative effect and add trillions more to the debt and increase taxes on middle class workers Moving the tax margins back to where they were before Reagan would be a good start Other options are to institute a trading tax on stocks federally decriminalize and make recreational marijuana taxable close glaringly large corporate tax loopholes and limit YOY loss rollover to years Markets are stimulated by increased activity Until people have more discretionary spending available that can t happen because too many people live paycheck to paycheck That would happen if you give them money or eliminate debt The one time payments haven t been very effective at stimulating the economy because those who needed it spent it and it s gone resulting in a short lived stimulant but flattening out because it s not enough and those who didn t saved it and it stagnates I think in order to justify the program you d have to identify the objective Is it to stimulate the economy It should work Is it to level load the balance sheets of m Americans so they have a chance at potentially not being the only generation in history declared to have a worse projected standard of living than their parents It would work Our economy cycles right now are growing closer and closer together and that s worrisome The black Monday bust under Reagan the dot com boom the real estate bubble the Great Recession the COVID crisis This is a result of a lack of lower and middle class having sustained good velocity of money due to poor wage increases higher than average housing and tuition increases and a lack of discretionary spending on top of upper income and corporation focused tax relief Would removing student debt accomplish increasing the velocity of money in that sector yes I would be interested to hear what your ideas for a more wide reaching and cost effective stimulus might look like Nobody has all of the answers as economies and markets are as we ve seen unpredictable But the foundational theory of the debt relief model is solid and it could set a catalyst for fixing the desperately broken college system in this country Part of what I do for work is study the forecasting models for large macroeconomic market conditions using big data at a major university The only time the projections fail is if all m recipients of relief save their cash flow for the rest of their life and never make a large economic purchase house land business or if they collectively all put it into the casino that is the stock market every month instead of using it to buy things now or save for large expenses That just isn t a very realistic possibility,t1_gn7e2jr,0

Reddit,gnaa35h,I always thought the problem was with the government getting involved with giving away student loans The loan system reform was introduced as an alternative to the prior status quo full public funding of public education Tuition was nominal consistent around a semester in todays dollars By shifting the costs to students and providing them guaranteed credit the government was able to save some money in the short term It was loaning money for a return instead of just spending it But in the long term there was a major change in who had the market power It used to be easy for the government to dictate terms to the universities as a monopolistic buyer but in the market model schools operate as oligopolistic competition The most visible change was in campus amenities Fully publicly funded schools were pretty spartan Dorms were tiny and there werent many facilities beyond the classroom or lab The government wasnt willing to pay for luxury dorms and new stadiums so they were exceedingly rare The government had all the market power as a monopolistic buyer and it had all the incentive to keep prices low year olds have little to no market power in the current situation If they refuse to buy the product their lifetime earnings will be reduced Price transparency is nonexistent because FAFSA student loan rates institutional aid scholarships tuition book costs and room board change annually They write the checks but they have no power individually to change the product,t1_gn9lsuw,8

Reddit,gn9bsuh,That makes sense and I can see where youre coming from I was fortunate to get an engineering degree a decade ago that I use daily and I was able to pay off my loans Nowadays many of my friends have jobs where they are dutifully paying to their student loans but years in their principal has barely budged I get why people want the loan forgiveness k k but that doesnt solve the problem but introduces many more Since you cant solve the entire problem at one time a very low interest rate on loans and maybe extend the payment period would help people have more money in their pocket to buy a small house and get themselves some stability so they can actually pay back the loan without needing a bailout All this backfires of course if jobs arent available or people spend more than they have or are unlucky and have a major hospital bill But it feels like a start in the right direction and about as center of a position as I can find,t1_gn94tvb,1

Reddit,gnevylj,State colleges need to attract students Private colleges are building more amenities to attract students make the claim to justify their expense State colleges do the same The entire market of tuition room board prices rise due to the fact that state colleges wish to compete in the same market to attract the money that they need Its not a waste of money to state colleges because that is what they need to do to market to the direct beneficiaries of their product This is a separate argument to the benefits of the government being the monopolistic buyer of the product instead of the case now where they are merely loan officers giving money to the many buyers and schools being oligopolistic sellers If the government is the only purchaser of college education on the behalf of a student applicant they can negotiate the prices of various elements for the class as a whole across multiple universities and colleges This has the effect of bringing down the price on education,t1_gnet4d1,5
