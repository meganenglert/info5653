addition to his salary as a federal judge That makes a lot more sense Why cant everything be like that Unless theres a plan to cancel student loan debt every several years or so well be right back

when you consider that the majority of student debt is held by people with post graduate degrees who make up only of Americans These are precisely the cohort that have benefited the most from the economy in the past few decade while most of those without degrees have either stayed put or have fallen behind It is simply unjust to give a boost to societys designated winners at the expense of the losers the main problem with student loans is that they allowed for the expense of education to inflated rapidly without any effort to keep cost under control Forgiving student does nothing to bring the schools under control and will likely see costs inflate even further since Uncle Sam will eventually forgive most of that debt anyway Thus loan forgiveness will exacerbate number even further It

problem In years we will be in the same position again The reason college is so expensive is because it is so easy to get tens of thousands of dollars to pay for it This is because the government backs the loans and the loans cannot be cleared through bankruptcy It is essentially free money for the lenders because there is no risk to them This influx of money combined with the notion that you have to attend college to be successful laughably wrong btw drove demand for college through the roof When demand goes up so do prices Colleges came up with all sorts of new degree programs to absorb the large number of less qualified students applying and then for profit schools sprang up to take the unqualified The bottom line is government backed loans created this problem If the bill doesn t do away with government backed loans that cannot be cleared through bankruptcy then it is nothing more than a vote buying scheme The real solution is to get the government out of the student aid business altogether Within a few years tuition will drop and no more young people will be saddled with a debt they can never hope to repay because banks will stop lending money to everyone with a pulse I would say a combination of paying everyone who currently has or had in the past a student loan up to and ending government backed or funded student loans makes the most sense Obviously the k

you re giving money to people who largely make more money than those who don t have college debt it s regressive The median new college grad starting out makes nearly year more than the median of all only HS grad Second it s a ton of money That s about months worth of Social security Or months at the median US wage of k So wealthier than average people really be getting that big a handout Third it s a terrible stimulus It s beubg sold as one but clearing someone s balance sheet has a fractional impact on increasing cash flow Thus for the amount of money being spend it is a bad stimulus Fourth Student Debt isn t even particularly large T sounds like a lot but Americans also have T in Auto debt and about the same in Credit Card debt And those latter two are actually distributed so the poor have more Fifth College Debt holders have already gotten more than non debt holders They ve gotten or so in deferred interest if they have in debt That s about the sum of the stimulus checks if the is approved Sixth that demographic of College Educated people are less likely to have lost their jobs than those who don t have one So you d be giving money to people less likely to have been impacted by

to the sources but they exist a google away I went to college and I chose my college with cost in mind I come from a single parent household where my mom was a teacher so by no means rich I am and I could pay off my student loans right now Free college exists they are given in scholarships If we want to talk about free college I could be convinced If we wanted to buy all the student loans and not collect interest I could be convinced If we wanted to create scholarships so it was free to most or significantly cheaper for all I could be convinced But providing a handout to people who make above

a workaround Make it so that it applies as long as you make one payment a year', 'I have worked in Higher Ed for some time There are two main issues that lead to student debt are colleges and the government Inefficient colleges coupled with increased loan availability from the govt leads to students making bad decisions and falling into more debt The colleges themselves Most are massive land holding entities that spend more money on developing land around their campus building amenities at the university rather than investing in staff curriculum development etc Most Schools are trying to sell you an experience rather than an education They will improve dorms gyms stadiums build e sports arenas but have dilapidated classrooms without functioning HVAC systems Inefficiencies Colleges make money on a few programs and lose money on the majority of their programs Colleges will keep programs with low enrollment at a loss because a Professor or Director has clout with the hierarchy Made up programs A lot of colleges do not consult industry as much as they should when developing curriculum instead because of the point above colleges start making programs to fill existing seats You take a few classes from one program a few classes for another and voila you have a completely new degree Now you will only get people so what do you have to do create another made up degree Schools will sell these as highly customizable degrees but basically its all their unwanted leftovers Lack of foresight Colleges will make huge risky investments that take years to develop rather than having a rainy day fund If you are wondering why schools with billion dollar endowments qualified for COVID relief Well that endowment is not liquid Most of it is land holding So the university can sink million into a luxury commercial building that will have no university use however this is an upfront cost that will take years to see revenue So when something like COVID hits and you have two or three of those projects you are SOL Budgeting in general Again going off of my previous inefficiency theme You would be shocked at the amount of gambles Universities make For starters most schools rely on tuition grants donations to function The biggest cash cow is generally the undergrad class If a school gets undergrad student this year they budget next year expecting rather than playing it safe They shell out money for development like that is years away Then al l of the sudden someone gets shot raped on campus and it makes the national news Next years undergrad class ends up having students as a result All of the sudden you are short million in your budget because students arnt paying for tuition rom and board What do you do cut pay increase lay off staff you sure as shit cant take the money back from your development projects Ultimately people leave and the student experience suffers Government FAFSA Loan Limits continue to move up this allows colleges to continue raising the cost of attendance without having repercussions A typical masters degree costs k in the US and most people complete them in about two years Why because the aggregate limit per year for standard grad loans is The aggregate limit for total Stafford graduate loans is about K Since you cannot take out more than in Stafford govt undergrad loans So essentially every person who gets into a Masters program can pay for it fully only using loans If this limit goes up the average tuition rate will move right with it Even though this is not the govts goal it is essentially exacerbating the cost of attendance by allowing massive amounts of student loans to be taken out There is very little that the govt is doing to keep schools accountable infact by increasing loan limits each year they are doing the opposite They are continuously rewarding bad behavior with more funding If there were a way to limit the amount of loans the cost of tuition would inevitably have to go down though this would take time', 'I feel it doesnt address the root of the problem I would prefer they invest in free community college and pre K rather than throw money at people', 'Lets say people each have X dollars and they both want a college education a new car a shiny fancy widget and a Disney vacation Person A spends his X dollars on college education and borrows money to buy the car the widget and

off Person Bs debt and not Person A', 'Yeah I paid off my loans already but Im totally for this Those loans are crippling to so many people IMO it stiffles innovation by forcing people to take soul sucking corporate gigs instead of going off to innovate and find ways to make a big impact on society Think of it as an investment in the economy The real solution should be to make college more affordable though so people dont have to take out crippling loans to go to school', 'I am against this idea because I have made sacrifices in order to not have student loan debt', 'No It s not a good idea Besides the obvious unfairness of it it has many unintended consequences Recent grads who now have less debt to pay can accept lower salaries and they ll begin bidding down wages which just adds even more injury to people who already paid off their loans It will only lead to more reckless and irresponsible borrowing If you want people to stop accruing massive student debt stop guaranteeing massive student loans It really is that simple Colleges will be forced to lower prices', 'No its a very stupid idea It is a wealth transfer to people who will already on the whole end up wealthier than the average American since college grads still have much higher lifetime net earnings than non college grads Furthermore it only helps those who currently hold debt Not those who have paid their debt off not those who have yet to take on debt not those who chose cheaper colleges to take on less debt not those worked through out college to pay for their education not those who joined the military to have their college payed for No one forced people to take on huge amounts of student debt they made that decision for themselves That doesnt mean there shouldnt be some type of relief for people who were deceived or are truly being crushed right now but there is no reason it has to be complete forgiveness and it should not be at the expense of other people who made different decisions Now cancelling the interest on government loans some type of universal public service loan forgiveness relief for people who were duped by unscrupulous for profit institutions these are reasonable

its a dumb idea How is that fair for hard working people who didnt go to college and just worked the whole time now make less money AND we end up paying the way for those that dont want to re pay

more expensive I also think public service forgiveness should be pro rated monthly rather than only after years of service with easily made paperwork error disqualifiers I worked years in a public service job at a significantly lower than private sector salary while paying an IBR monthly payment that didn t cover interest Life changed my ability to hold the public service job and now I owe more than I borrowed', 'It doesnt matter anymore if its a good idea or not could be or even in loan forgiveness Only way the Fed can keep this ship afloat is to print print print Based on foundational

don t know the solution but as a person that had k in loans and has paid a month for over years so close to k my principal has only gone down k I am sitting at a k balance right now This interest free period has allowed me to save up all of my payments so that I can actually pay down principal I currently have k saved So after one year of interest free forbearance I will have paid more down on my principal than I have making payment for over years When I consolidated my loans interest was percent I will never get out from under this at that rate I am not asking for forgiveness but would like

to come from somewhere to which would be the taxpayer and not all taxpayers went to school In fact most taxpayers did not go to college A better alternative is to drop the federal loan program A lot of the reason why school has become so expensive is because so much money has become available since just about anyone can take out a loan due to them being federally secured The school ends up getting its money and the lender and borrower are on the hook Schools have become giant scams offering so many niche degrees that really have no real value in the real world and so many people are getting hooked with them The reality is most of us have no need to go to higher education Learning a trade or going straight into the workforce is the better alternative Im on the type that unless

of inflation', 'It s a good idea if it s done alongside a serious plan to reduce costs Simply erasing debt does nothing to fix long term cost increases A lot of posts have mentioned administrative costs etc as a main driver of cost increases and I agree but I think one change that also needs to be made is student expectations of what college is I went to college in Europe for a year and the facilities were very bare bones American students have an expectation of what colleges should be fancy student center new sports facilities fancy dorms and that is a big driver of costs too Too much

flat since and wages in most STEM science technology engineering and math occupations have grown anemically over the past decade And this the Economic Policy Institute maintains was the result of policy decisions This dismal wage growth is the result of intentional policy choices made on behalf of those with the most income wealth and political power As explained below these choices fall into five broad categories the abandonment of full employment as a main objective of economic policymaking declining union density various labor market policies and business practices policies that have allowed CEOs and finance executives to capture ever larger shares of economic growth and globalization policies Collectively these policy decisions have shifted economic power away from low and middle

economic consequences that are not always fair Some people adopted babies in the years before the adoption tax credit was passed for example was it fair to them that taxpayers who adopted children a

education has changed Perhaps not in the ways one might think Firstly university is much more accessible now than it ever has been despite the costs Students are awarded more opportunities for experience and hands on work More fields and specializations are available That requires more work from professors or more accurately instructors More programs are available to students to help with their studies Writing Centers receive much more funding than they ever did as well as other learning center programs Programs for the health of students have been introduced since the s such as on site nursing and mental health aid We can make the costs of the university go down but that will require us to remove a HUGE amount of services that would make university much much less accessible available and useful All that to say singular schools would be much better equipped to deal with their own spending problems Administrations have more say over their budgets than anyone and WOW do many administrations waste a ton of money', 'Yes Im fine with the loan forgiveness if we fix the underlying problem Putting a bandaid on it may help me out personally but its not going to help

bandaid Because here s the thing for a lot of people that s not a bandaid it s a lifeline A lifeline that happens to goose the economy too', 'I agree with radically changing the system but that takes time and a majority of representatives to agree on what needs to be done AND the appropriate fixes To tell someone to wait for these circumstances to align while they struggle with debt because it

productivity it all was on a steady upward growth cycle for the most part until and then BOOM It all started to slowly crash and then flat line and stagnate Take minimum wage for example I know it can be a controversial topic sometimes but if it had kept up with inflation and the increase in worker productivity ever notice how jobs are having person do the job that people used to do it would be over hour now Then look at the prices of goods services College tuition for example since were on the subject wow It took me years for undergrad at my university back in the early s and it was around total for that time Now Its PER SEMESTER K per year That is simply ridiculous IMO Something has to be done about this our economy and wages in general The way things are going it is literally unsustainable If it keeps up eventually no one will be able to afford anything', 'I dont know why they dont try to use bargaining or price controls to keep student debt under control', 'Demand and competition have gone up though Prices wont stay stagnant under those circumstances', 'The problem started when the federal government stepped in to grant students loans and lobbyist allowed college debt to follow you even if you declare bankruptcy If the federal government is no longer involved then students would not be given absorbent loans for degrees that will obviously never get a return on the loan therefore lowering the cost of college in general', 'Because everyone takes money out of education funding', 'I don t disagree that root causes need to be addressed but tiny band aid seems like a mis characterization of this solution This is a lot of money for a lot of people that will just remove debts that have been or have the potential to follow people around for decades', 'In the s and s union jobs were common without a degree Those dont exist anymore Not in the numbers needed So more and more people are getting degrees driving up cost I always hear about people saying how expensive school is but not a single person is talking about what to do about it State schools are affordable Technical colleges are affordable People need to be responsible with their lives and not take on more debt than they can afford by going to a school they cant afford The solutions to massive student debt are all right there in front of them yet they choose to ignore it', 'Well yes but the outcomes that are these massive debt burdens should be relieved The debt has the bigger real consequence than the system that created it imo', 'That tiny band aid would be a life changing event for actual real live people How about we just do both at once Can we handle that', 'Exactly If we forgive the debt the problem is going to come back in a few years time so instead we probably need at minimize the amount of interest that goes onto student loans especially if the answer isnt going to be something along the lines of a free college program which for whatever reason will be difficult to get through Congress but possible on the State level in some places So I would start by recommending a student loan interest cap on all federal student loans The idea is you have a number that is some percentage of the actual student loan you get lets say to keep it easy and when you accrue a lifetime interest of of that loan no more interest is accrued and then you pay back the loan as normal without having to worry about gathering any additional interest With this you are able to keep most of the existing infrastructure in place and because there would be a cap in place to keep student debt from going completely out of control income based repayment becomes a real and viable option for actually paying off student loans There is probably going to be a need to cap the interest on existing federal loans that are way past any cap percentage that anyone would recommend that way there would at least be an end in sight for a lot of these borrowers Obviously I think this would need to be done alongside other major changes like addressing textbooks for profit colleges free tuition alongside other wider reaching changes like increases to minimum wage This is just a suggestion I have been thinking about because I know I personally have done well under the current system but I have done so while certain individuals have suffered greatly from absolutely crippling debt This is just a way to fix the system and not getting rid of all of the jobs and positions that currently exist now because of the system and can serve as a stepping stone to eventually phase the system out entirely when its possible', 'While I agree that the system needs to be fixed if I get stabbed I would still like the EMTs to try and stop the bleeding before they give me a CT scan to see if any vital organs were punctured Debt forgiveness while not a fix does give complete relief to million Americans and I can get behind helping of the country while we work on a real long term solution to the education issues we have in this country', 'YES Thank god this is the top comment I m all for college debt forgiveness I do not have college debt but it s not fair to the subsequent generations year olds now who will begin amassing the exact same debt going forward', 'Ill start with saying I completely agree My question is what exactly can legistlated to fix this What parts of the college education cost can be regulated enough to make a difference Thats the question I personally struggle with even as a proponent of this idea', 'All of these problems can be boiled down to one phenomenon the rise of the administrator Universities are exponentially more expensive now because universities became businesses somewhere down the line and businesses need administrators But universities are not meant to be businesses and indeed the business model runs contrary to at least one of the university s missions which is the impartial awarding of grades on the basis of merit That s hard enough to achieve in a merit centric model but when your students are literally paying customers it becomes disincentivized outright So they hire more and more admins to fill ever multiplying marketing niches essentially It s no wonder most of our universities have become sports teams with schools attached having a good team is great marketing So another utterly predictable side effect of this is that profs are encouraged to go easy on college athletes Did they do C work Then maybe we should consider awarding them a B or change a b to a B ad infinitum And the predictable side effect of that is that grades increasingly fail to reflect the quality of one s actual work This way of organizing education is counterproductive and as we can all plainly see unsustainable So we can reform higher education now by ripping the bandaid off and mandating the removal of all nonessential administrators a solution that would do immense short term harm to those whose livelihoods are found in university administration or wait for the system to collapse under the weight of its own overhead The problem with waiting is that in the meantime costs will continue to rise and graduation will become more and more dependent on income This will obviously exacerbate income inequality even more as hard as that might be to imagine', 'Yes exactly The reason for the increase in costs is due to government backed student loans coupled with bloated administrative costs These types of loans allowed colleges to charge increasingly more money with the knowledge that students will pay because the government will be backing these loans Students take on high levels of debt and there is no incentive to decrease tuition because the demand is still high for the those loans', 'Both debt relief and college affordability are good ideas Why not have both One does not cancel the other Debt relief for my wife and affordable college for my daughter', 'I do agree with you entirely I m just going to play the devils advocate for a second One of the common explanations for why colleges and universities have become more expensive over the years is because while the quality of the education has not increased the quality of the facilities have increased Better dorms lab equipment gym equipment common areas relaxation spots etc have played into the rising cost because those things are expensive to build and maintain and the students get access to them while there So would it be worth it to get rid of these facility improvements some or all in order to help reduce tuitions For now let s focus on this topic exclusively I know there is a whole menagerie of issues that drive up costs but I m interested on y all s opinion of this', 'Ive just paid for an online class that has amounted to Read the

assured that almost anyone regardless of their economic situation could get a loan Because anyone could get a loan colleges were free to send their tuition costs skyrocketing Because tuition costs

in fact wake things worse for groups Y Z and beyond Theres also the problem that it sends a solid message to group X and probably to group Y Z and beyond that they dont need to take any responsibility

Secretary of Education Elizabeth Warren etc about this My interest rates across my various federal loans average so that I too have paid more than half the amount I borrowed but the vast majority has gone towards interest rather than principal Lowering interest rates in order to empower borrowers to actually repay our loans strikes a decent balance between much needed assistance which doubles as economic stimulus when loans are able to be repaid and our money then spent elsewhere and the complaints that outright forgiveness is unfair to those who have already finished paying off their loans Lower them for all federal loan holders not just undergraduates as Ive seen proposals for forgiveness doing My expensive professional degree has provided me with a decent income let me spend it

hugely beneficial', 'Just want to chime in from a European perspective thats how educational loans work in a number of countries here Germany has a system where you get an allowance based on your

And those k are interest free you have to start paying back five years after your studies have ended and only if you are not unemployed or earn below a certain threshold If Im not mistaken the Scandinavian countries have a system where the amount does not depend on your parents income and you only have to start paying back once you earn more than a certain amount of money', 'The interest is high because its ostensibly an unsecured loan There is no physical collateral to repossess to get the lenders money back Except student loan debt is unbankruptable The only way to shake it is to pay

state legislatures cutting higher education budgets bit by bit over ish years', 'Ive tried to make that point but that poster hit it spot on They said it in a much more convincing way Essentially to forgive student loan debt for every debtor would be a grossly inequitable policy Just as that post points out there are many who did not assume the burden of debt who will be shafted Whats worse many of the debtors who suddenly are relieved of their debt burden get a substantial leg up in wealth building over so many others who either never took on debt or who already paid it off I wont go through the example Ive used before but in basic terms over time the elimination of say monthly loan payment will go a long way for young recent graduates to leap older more temporally distant graduates in wealth building Likewise a college graduates income ceiling is generally much greater than a non college graduate In other words not only will the college graduate earn more money in their lifetime but the short term financial sacrifice necessary to achieve that would be eliminated The long term effects of such an inequitable policy are almost never discussed and maybe not seriously considered There are other ways to help people who are truly struggling with no light at the end of the tunnel For one as many others have commented reduce interest rates so the monthly payment applies to nearly all of the principal Another make it easier to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy and include legal safeguards to protect against debtors feigning poverty to get the benefit of bankruptcy There

are outrageously expensive For me there was no cost difference between a state school and a private school because state schools are so expensive where I live Ive been attending a cheap online

where its basically impossible to make enough money to pay it up front loans are pretty much inevitable Minimum wage is where I live non minimum wage jobs dont pay much better In other words its not that A already suffered and got theirs while B is suffering Its that A got their reward no debt and B got theirs meaningful university experience and now B wants to get As reward too This is way too simple for this kind of situation We need to look at the material effect of massive student loan debt and astronomical college costs on the population Many people with degrees are severely underpaid but have more debt despite these low wages This leads to delays in starting their careers moving out on their own buying a house and even having children in the future if thats what they want Theres lots of people my age who want to have children but have come to the realization that they most likely wont be financially stable enough to have children I dont want children personally but Ive realized I will most likely never be able to buy a house I am far from alone Many people dont go to the doctor when something is wrong which of course often leads to worse health outcomes later down

genius to figure out just how bad all of this is for the economy and society overall And then throw a climate crisis on top of all this So this notion that people who went to college and took out loans to do so didnt have to make sacrifices or put their life on hold is bullshit It is a very poor understanding of the situation we are in as a society I graduated not even years ago and I already feel like my life is over Its not going to get better We need to do SOMETHING because things are about to get real bad Forgive or whatever amount Abolish the interest rates erase interest amounts from balances and apply interest payments already made towards the principal amount Automatically forgive after years no matter what Make it possible to declare bankruptcy on student loans private ones too

with charging because People are okay with paying that amount of money because College loans are so heavily subsidized that there s not enough actual cost because Colleges charge as much hm IMO what needs to happen is the government needs to stop giving students cheap loans and student loans need to stop being exempt from discharge under bankruptcy Private loans especially with the added risk of bankruptcy are more expensive so the real cost of college loans rises More people decide it s a raw deal and opt out of college for trade schools or entrepreneurship and such College demand drops and

textbooks have a high price pirating textbooks has never been easier For the flip side of digitization is that when everything is online it s much easier to get it for free Also textbooks are only a

wise to fund education and the same reason success stories from those graduates are still valuable It reinforces that education itself is a good thing in the mind of the public because later education

them one that they d normally only get through due to bankruptcy anyway but the law doesn t allow them to Morally and monetarily in terms of economic stimulus waiving student loan debt gives that

the poirest of the population I d gladly agree with a bigger tax cut here say no tax with a k deduction But I d want no taxes under k Which would mean the cap for social security taxes to move up from k to k preferably higher enough to increase rather than decrease SS income And move all the tax brackets beyond the first up by so many k focusing on the higher brackets that tax income increases not decreases Then you have a society that doesn t tax the lower class anymore and doesn t that sound great And talk about economic stimulus that s as much as k per month per person for the lower middle class up to k per year It benefits you less the less money you make of course and more the more you make until you get rich enough the tax savings aren t relevant to your day to day life k a month is pretty big for me don t know about you Of course realistically we need to raise the highest tax bracket The top one percent already pays of all taxes paid and they are at their lowest tax rate in decades A minor increase in them combined with a big relief to the lower middle class would be a better stimulus hands down If you have a job of course If you don t you can bankruptcy for skip out of

their daily lives Democrats represent business interests which would benefit from economic stimulus and see the tax cuts and stimulus as benefitting those businesses Passing a tax cut of the magnitude comparable to waiving all those student loans is not really thinkable without blowing up the national debt or getting a majority to believe we need to raise taxes That s why I would advocate for more progressive democrats over liberals too In the meantime though yeah let Biden put a bandage on things until progressive democrats over liberal democrats have an advantage and democrats as a whole are

the life of the borrower another years if avg age is It would cover itself easily within years It s worth noting that the reasons stimulus checks work to both stimulate and steady the economy is because they increase the velocity of money This move would be doing that on a scale we haven t seen before Increasing the velocity of money by an increased b per month for the life of the borrower Most economists agree that student debt relief would make a measurable immediate and long lasting impact on steadying our boom bust economy and strengthening the USD', 'Alright let s assume your numbers are true and it would free up roughly per month if the k were forgiven The government spends T to do that There s about m American student debt holders let s assume equal impact for arguments sake and each one sees the same benefit That s million people now seeing a mo benefit million x billion per month freed up in cash flow T program B increased cash flow roughly months or just over years in equated revenue The increased economic activity would result in far more tax revenue than the direct payments to the government because the benefit is lifelong where the loan balances had an expiry So now those m people buy homes property tax for life school tax or cars sales and auto tax or even just consumer goods sales tax which then props up businesses which employ people income tax and it holds the economy steady strengthening the USD In theory all of the benefits of trickle down economics only this time they re real The velocity of money would increase which would stabilize the economy That s the whole point Not to mention the federal government is not in the student loan business to make a profit They are providing student loans to borrowers so that they can reap the economic and societal benefit of having a more educated and healthy workforce I m sure if you do the math student loan borrowers who have been paying their loans for years have already paid back their principle balance but because the interest rates are so high and interest is capped from distribution a staggering amount of interest is added to them As a government they do not and should not

the now well established fact that young kids are less vulnerable to COVID and far less likely to die of it if they catch it kids actually are more likely to die of the flu and its very difficult to

It was loaning money for a return instead of just spending it But in the long term there was a major change in who had the market power It used to be easy for the government to dictate terms to the universities as a monopolistic buyer but in the market model schools operate as oligopolistic competition The most visible change was in campus amenities Fully publicly funded schools were pretty spartan Dorms were tiny and there werent many facilities beyond the classroom or lab The government wasnt willing to pay for luxury dorms and new stadiums so they were exceedingly rare The government had all the market power as a monopolistic buyer and it had all the incentive to keep prices low year olds have little to no market power in the current situation If they refuse to buy the product

Federal Highway Administration to study the feasibility of a toll financed system of three east west and three north south superhighways The study entitled Toll Roads and Free Roads rejected the idea of a toll network but proposed a system of toll free interregional highways with connections to and around cities The network of highways would meet the needs of increasing automobile traffic and the requirements of national defense in time of war However for all their visionary skills they are sometimes criticized for their opposition to toll roads For example Phil Patton in Open Road A Celebration of the American Highway Simon and Schuster described how Toll Roads and Free Roads rejected the toll option based on traffic figures showing low demand in most corridors and predicted that the Philadelphia to Pittsburgh corridor would carry only cars a day The BPR had no notion that the construction of new superhighways like the introduction of such inventions as the telephone and the auto itself might create its own demand Similarly Dan Cupper in The Pennsylvania Turnpike A History Applied Arts Publishers Second Revised Edition pointed out that ridership after the turnpike opened on October completely defied the pessimistic predictions vehicles a day of the U S Bureau of Public Roads By the need for a Interstate was a pressing topic Although the President favored a self financing toll network the committee proposed creation of a Federal Highway Corporation The Federal Aid Highway Act was a large compromise in funding due to doubts still on traffic With creating The Highway Trust Fund as a dedicated revenue source for the Interstate System where Revenue from the Federal gas and other motor vehicle user taxes was credited to the Highway Trust Fund to pay the Federal share of Interstate construction and all other Federal aid highway projects In this way the Act guaranteed construction of all segments on a pay as you go basis thus satisfying one of

and the state university I got my masters at The point is that PhDs and non professional masters grads have a very specific set of job options with more applicants than openings Its a great achievement but not something worth going into debt for Students with the best outcomes were funded because that funding meant involvement in research projects with tenured professors Funding isnt just the money its a sign of support professionally Research is part of the portfolio The degree without experience isnt worth much I dont know her situation but thats the general understanding in academia Unfunded students take on more debt for less support and worse outcomes Similar situation to unpaid internships vs paid except more is at stake in academics', 'So wait is she a medical doctor and went to med school or MD PhD Thats not the same thing medical school tuition other professional degrees like MBA are much more than typical graduate tuition', 'Florida I went to a state uni for undergrad and a private for grad school The state and private uni differ very little for my graduate classes Out of state and private colleges are a complete rip off I got accepted into duke with no scholarships and elected not to go due to costs It s insane I never would have went to my private school if every graduate program wasn t insane Regardless an out of state or k a year private school isn t the norm Edit undergrad was about k total I did a year at community college a lot of us did and worked part time I had no loans when I left Graduate was k per year Nearly all my loans are from

Idk why everyone thinks you need to go to college either If i could do it over id drop out in th grade and start working Minus a government economics course in th grade it was all review same shit every year Trade schools and colleges have there place but if our grade school and votec programs worked right you shouldnt need them As broken as it is right now you can go highschool to a union

comparison If we do X like Zimbabwe we will suffer Y outcome also like Zimbabwe That is your argument My point and a position that would be wholeheartedly supported by nearly the entire economics profession is that the US and Zimbabwe operate in completely different universes in terms of the economic gravity impacting them They are not comparable When it comes to economic rules the United States is sine qua non for the global economy whereas Zimbabwe is a mere afterthought As such you cannot or rather should not use Zimbabwe as an example of what might befall the United States', 'Keep

who you responded to asking how it makes sense for anything other than a parent to a kid like two comments up lmao And the point of paying when its interest is so it doesnt become NOT interest', 'What do you think happens right now if you don t pay your loans Or your taxes It s all coercive force anyways My suggestion is just to get rid of interest with the underlying explanation that there is still a need to pay them off and the government will be able to forge you to', 'That makes sense and I can see where youre coming from I was fortunate to get an engineering degree a decade ago that I use daily and I was able to pay off my loans Nowadays many of my friends have jobs where they are dutifully paying to their student loans but years in their principal has barely budged I get why people want the loan forgiveness k k but that doesnt solve the problem but introduces many more Since you cant solve the entire problem at one time a very low interest rate on loans and maybe extend the payment period would help people have more money in their pocket to buy a small house and get themselves some stability so they can actually pay back the loan without needing a bailout All this backfires of course if jobs arent available or people spend more than they have or are unlucky and have a major hospital bill But it feels like a start in the right direction and about as center of a position as I can find', 'Unless youre a published policy expert in the field why should I trust your analysis of the data over published policy experts in the field', 'Which would be b cut current spending', 'If it actually was a common good then Id agree but of the adult population benefit from this This is half the reason so many people are against the idea The other half being that you

exactly do you think they do it Hint federal student loans', 'Interesting Thank you for actually explaining your points', 'State colleges need to attract students Private colleges are building more amenities to attract students make the claim to justify their expense State colleges do the same The entire market of tuition room board prices rise due to the fact that state colleges wish to compete in the same market to attract the money that they need Its not a waste of money to state colleges because that is what they need to do to market to the direct beneficiaries of their product This is a separate argument to the benefits of the government being the monopolistic buyer of the product instead of the case now where they are merely loan officers giving money to the many buyers and schools being oligopolistic sellers If the government is the only purchaser of college education on the behalf of a student applicant they can negotiate the prices of various elements for the class as a whole

not require a degree in the field I was working in real estate and many of the engineers that worked there DOT did not have college degrees and many were not licensed or were working on becoming licensed I have also spent most of my career as a self employed residential remodeling contractor and none of the other trades that I work with have workers with college degrees My degree did nothing

suffer with interest on K of debt Thats the type of injustice Im taking about Youre talking about averages and the majority Thats a classic way to ignore and justify the problems with any system Averages and majorities dont address the people who get screwed over The average person benefits from Obamacare for example but there are some who get hosed Should we stop worrying about improving the healthcare system then Also the point is that this type of economic stimulus is some Biden can do without needing to deal with the filibuster in the Senate The GOP is probably going to try to let the

is a physical therapist years ago a year degree enough Then a masters now it is a doctorate The scope of practice expanded science moved forward and now it requires more education Likely in another generation it will require specialization much like Medical Doctors and engineers Perhaps when you worked for the DOT they allowed people to design roads without a Civil Engineering degree and just ojt But now No way it requires the signature of a professional engineer PE which requires a year degree passing the Fundimentals of engineering instert field here exam and working some number of years under an existing PE Are there jobs at the DOT that dont require college Yes and probably the majority dont need college But many do and thoes that do are probably not paying enough to cover the cost

will change their votes based on this single issue alone and yet theres only one party discussing k forgiveness Lets not be completely disingenuous here Youre right I actually misspoke I forgot which comment thread I was responding to I do think it could and would alienate a portion of the democratic partys base Quite a few members of traditionally under represented demographics showed up in the

benefit from the education Im all for people who went to colleges where they were in essence defrauded having their loans forgiven Thats no where near the amount of people who would be helped under a blanket forgiveness Furthermore those people in your example would still have access to IBR and REPAYE and PSLF so there are programs available to people who fall into this category as limited as it is If you asked me I would rather have a bankruptcy system where people who were in dire straits could get out from under their debt but imo to have a blanket forgiveness is a bad use of public funds

name on the design when it goes to get vetted I said I was willing to pay some of the costs of college which I do by way of the hundreds of millions of dollars that the state collects each year that are used in the state college system I dont think I need to pay the full freight for the whole cost though The person getting the degree that allows the to earn more than those without should pay their share too', 'IMO and all forget about all these financial services and just have free public universities', 'I have some sympathies for children who get into this mess but if were talking about people at the age of majority or higher I dont know what else to do Do we tell people they cant take out loans until theyre because thats when the cortex fully develops according to science If so Im fine with that but there would be huge consequences to that action I dont know the exact solution but there should be some sort of restriction The entire basis of contract law is consent so if people cant make good decisions about massive future debt why philosophically should we uphold the contracts The entire system is suspect IMO Furthermore those people in your example would still have access to IBR and REPAYE and PSLF so there are programs available to people who fall into this category as limited as it is Sure but these are incredibly difficult to keep up with especially if youre low income and low education In the last administration we saw how the SecEd can mess with the application process and make things like PSLF effectively not exist If you asked me I would rather have a bankruptcy system where people who were in dire straits could get out from under their debt This could be a solution especially given the sketchy nature of kids taking out loans and getting into

of private schools so the government can negotiate better deals with private schools but they are the schools It is like saying medical care would be cheaper in Australia if only we banned private medical care They already have public health care We already have public universities', 'I did the same If they live on campus they can take time to work part time or accept higher loans The choice is theirs The minimum for anyone is tuition however Room and board is optional There is nothing stopping you from living somewhere cheaper or getting a room mate nearby unless the college requires room and board which I think should not be allowed Textbooks are a complete scam No argument here', 'Youre right I should not have commented on the specifics of a place you worked But my point stands that road is not getting built without someone with a college degree I was using my work as an proxy for yours out technologist have year degrees and our staff have MS and PhD I dont think I need to pay the full freight for the whole cost though Few are asking you to What most people want is for college to be affordable especially given the future earning potential If you get a loan to get something that is advertised that servicing the loan is trivial but is the opposite is typically characterized as pteditory There a many career paths that require encourage college degrees that do not pay enough to service the loans teachers architect social workers etc That is a problem We also dont want to lock people out of higher education because their parents were poor Making college unaffordable means only the wealthy get to be professionals This is bad for many reasons which I dont want to enumerate and I hope you agree by way of the hundreds of millions of dollars that the state collects each year that are used in the state college system It is very expensive to operate universities see the student debt number States have been defunding their schools for decades The costs have been increasingly shouldered by the students Research facilities are x the cost per square foot of a similar size facility hazardus substances clean rooms testing equipment etc', 'Private and STATE universities take FEDERAL grants in a system where the individual choosing the price has no say on negotiation The Federal system in place should put pressure on all universities to lower prices and the best way to do that is to be the negotiator for price across all universities The current system has no incentives for anyone to look out for the debtors in this case the students']\n",
